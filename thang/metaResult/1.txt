<abstract confidence="0.999305636363637">In this paper, we describe a framework for a personalization system to systematically induce desired emotion and attention related states and promote information processing in viewers of online advertising and e-commerce product information. Psychological Customization entails personalization of the way of presenting information (user interface, visual layouts, modalities, structures) per user to create desired transient psychological effects and states, such as emotion, attention, involvement, presence, persuasion and learning. Conceptual foundations and empiric evidence for the approach are presented</abstract>
