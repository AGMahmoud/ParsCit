Further, our approach is based on semantic weight rather than word frequency. Therefore any frequency based measures defined by Boyd et al. (1994) and Wendlandt (1991) need to be built from the probabilities of individual semantic categories. Those modifications are described below. As a simplifying assumption, we assume SEMCATs have a uniform </context>

In order to facilitate the use of long runs as predictors, we modified the traditional measures of Boyd et al. (1994), Wendlandt (1991) to accommodate semantic categories and partial text retrieval. The revised metrics and the computational method we propose were used in the statistical experiments presented above. </context>
