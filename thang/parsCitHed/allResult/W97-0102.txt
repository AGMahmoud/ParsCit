Researchers typically use traditional lexical scanner and parser tools for projects requiring
the recognition of complex text elements. The role relegated to the lexical scanner is
usually the simple tokenization while the relationships of the tokens to one another is
done by the parser. Implementation of products or features using these tools for VLC can
require months of processing or even years.
In this talk, I will describe how extending the capabilities of the lexical scanner while
optlmi~ng its performance can allow it to complete the recognition work traditionally
done by parsers. This technique allows for flexible reprocessing of VLC that might
otherwise not be done when improvements to algorithms are made. I will illustrate this
with a case study of the recognition of embedded case law citations, including anaphoric
references, and case names.
