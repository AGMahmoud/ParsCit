Abstract
# Para 12 7
The paper presents a corpus-based method 
for finding metaphorically used lex-
emes and prevailing semantico-conceptu-
al source domains, given a target domain 
corpus. It is exemplified by a case study 
on the target domain of European politics, 
based on a French 800,000 token corpus.

1 Introduction
# Para 20 12
This investigation is situated within the frame-
work of the Hamburg Metaphor Database1 (HMD) 
(L¨onneker and Eilts, 2004), which collects manual 
annotations of metaphors in context. HMD anno-
tation terminology refers to cognitive linguistic ac-
counts of metaphor. These suggest that abstract 
“target” concepts are often thought and talked of in 
terms of less abstract “source” concepts (Section 2). 
On these accounts, the paper presents a method for 
finding metaphorically used lexical items and char-
acterizing the conceptual source domains they be-
long to, given a target domain corpus.
# Para 32 9
After mentioning related work on metaphor an-
notation (Section 3), we exemplify our method by a 
case study on the target domain of European pol-
itics, for which a French 800,000 token corpus is 
prepared and imported into a corpus manager (Sec-
tion 4). Using corpus manager functions, a small 
set of highly salient collocates of Europe are classi-
fied as candidates of metaphorical usages; after as-
sessing their metaphoricity in context, these lexemes

# Para 43 9
are grouped into semantico-conceptual domains for 
which, in a final step, additional lexical instanti-
ations are searched (Section 5). Two important 
source domains (BUILDING and MOTION) are de-
tected, which are supported by over 1,000 manual 
corpus annotations. The domains can be charac-
terized as small networks of EuroWordNet synsets 
(nodes) and lexical as well as conceptual relations 
(Section 6). Section 7 concludes the paper.
# Para 52 1
2 Theoretical Aspects
# Para 53 9
The Conceptual Theory of Metaphor (CTM) worked 
out originally by (Lakoff and Johnson, 1980) claims 
that conceptual metaphors such as GOOD IS UP 
and TIME IS MONEY structure the way we think 
and influence the way we use language. Concep-
tual metaphors are mappings between conceptual 
domains, for example between the target domain 
GOOD and the less abstract source domain UP, or 
between TIME (target) and MONEY (source).
# Para 62 10
Conceptual metaphors are rarely directly referred 
to in speech or writing: Whereas time is money is a 
standing expression in English, this is much less so 
for many other conceptual mappings (cf. ?good is 
up). Consequently, corpus analysis cannot have as a 
goal finding conceptual mappings as such. Rather, it 
can find their manifestations through non-literal us-
ages of lexical items – i.e., contexts in which source 
domain words are used to refer to elements in the 
target domain.
# Para 72 4
For example, high (a word from the UP source do-
main) means ‘good’ in the expression high marks; 
and spend or save, used in the source domain to re-
fer to actions involving money, refer to actions in the

target domain of TIME when used in contexts such as 
spend time or save time.
# Para 80 6
Adopting a broad notion of metaphor based on 
CTM, we refer to such non-literal usages (though 
often conventionalized) as lexical metaphors in this 
paper. Prominent conceptual metaphors are illus-
trated by a larger number of lexical metaphors, 
which support the systematicity of their mapping.
# Para 86 1
3 Related Work
# Para 87 3
Earlier projects annotating metaphor in corpora in-
clude (Martin, 1994) and (Barnden et al., 2002). In 
what follows, we give two examples of recent work.
# Para 90 13
Gedigian et al. (2006) annotated a subset of the 
Wall Street Journal for the senses of verbs from 
Motion-related, Placing, and Cure frames which 
were extracted from FrameNet (Fillmore et al., 
2003). The annotation shows that more than 90% 
of the 4,186 occurrences of these verbs in the corpus 
data are lexical metaphors in the above sense. Gedi-
gian et al. (2006) conclude that in the domain of eco-
nomics, Motion-related metaphors are used conven-
tionally to describe market fluctuations and policy 
decisions. A classifier trained on the annotated cor-
pus can discriminate between literal and metaphori-
cal usages of the verbs.
# Para 103 7
Lee (2006) compiled a 42,000 word corpus of 
transcribed doctor-patient dialogues, exhaustively 
hand-annotated for stretches of metaphorical lan-
guage. These are provided with conceptual labels 
enabling the author to identify prevalent and inter-
related metaphorical mappings used as part of com-
municative strategies in this domain.
# Para 110 1
4 The European Constitution Corpus
# Para 111 8
Exploration and annotation of a corpus to find infor-
mation regarding its predominant conceptual source 
domains is most productive when applied to an ab-
stract and novel target domain. Abstractness calls 
for ways to make the topic cognitively accessible, 
and novelty entails a certain openness about the par-
ticular source domains that might be activated for 
this purpose.
# Para 119 4
Abstractness and novelty are criteria fulfilled by 
the target domain selected for our study: European 
Constitutional politics. The domain is represented 
by the public discourse on the possible introduction 
# Para 123 6
of a European Constitution and on the corresponding 
French referendum (29 May 2005). The referendum 
allowed voters to accept or refuse the proposed Con-
stitution text (the result being refusal). The remain-
der of this section describes the sources of the corpus 
(4. 1), its acquisition (4.2), and pre-processing (4.3).
# Para 129 1
4.1 Sources
# Para 130 7
The corpus consists of two sub-corpora, collected 
from online versions of two French dailies, Le 
Monde and Le Figaro. The site lemonde.fr con-
tains each article published in the printed version of 
the socialist-liberal newspaper Le Monde, whereas 
lefigaro.fr contains articles from the conser-
vative newspaper Le Figaro.
# Para 137 1
4.2 Collection
# Para 138 15
From 27 April to 5 June, 2005, the above men-
tioned web sites were screened for articles on Eu-
rope and the European Constitution on a daily basis. 
For the case study presented in this paper, only arti-
cles dealing with the Constitution and discussing the 
referendum are retained. Each of these articles is a 
document of the European Constitution corpus and 
contains information on its publication date, author, 
and newspaper section (e.g. editorial). The selection 
of relevant articles is performed manually. This is 
labor-intensive but keeps noise to a minimum. As a 
guideline for distinguishing between “general” Eu-
ropean topics and the referendum on the European 
Constitution, key words including (European) Con-
stitution and referendum are used.
# Para 153 1
4.3 Preprocessing
# Para 154 10
The collected documents are converted into text for-
mat and annotated with a simple SGML tagset rep-
resenting document meta data (in the header), para-
graph boundaries, and sentence boundaries. Sen-
tence detection is performed reusing TreeTagger 
scripts2 because we POS-tag and lemmatize the 
texts using the TreeTagger (Schmid, 1994) and its 
French parameter file (Stein and Schmid, 1995). Fi-
nally, the corpus is verticalized for use with the 
Manatee/Bonito corpus manager (Rychl´y and Smrˇz,

Table 1 gives an overview of the two sub-corpora. 
When collecting the corpus, relevance to the topic 
had been our only criterion. Interestingly, the two 
newspaper corpora are very similar in size. This 
means that the selected topic was assigned equal im-
portance by the different newspaper teams. Tables 2 
and 3 show absolute frequencies of the top ten lem-
mas, filtered by a list of 725 French stop words3 but 
still including oui - ‘yes’ and non - ‘no’, buzz-words 
during the political debate on the European Consti-
tution. The frequent words also give an impression 
of the domain centeredness of the corpus.

5 Lexical Metaphors and Source Domains
# Para 193 15
Our aim is to determine empirically salient 
metaphorical source domains used in the target do-
main of European politics, combined with the prac-
tical interest in speeding up the detection and anno-
tation of lexical metaphors. In Subsection 3 above, 
two approaches to corpus annotation for metaphor 
were mentioned. Due to the size of the corpus 
and limited annotator resources, we cannot follow 
the full-text annotation approach adopted by Lee 
(2006). Neither do we proceed as Gedigian et al. 
(2006), because that approach pre-selects source do-
mains and lemmas. In our approach, we search for 
metaphorically used lexical items from initially un-
known source domains, so interesting lemmas can-
not be listed a priori.
# Para 208 5
Therefore, we developed a new method which 
makes efficient use of existing corpus manager func-
tions. The only constant is the representation of the 
target domain, predefined at a high level by the se-
lection of our corpus. We fixed the lemma Europe

vestigation proceeds in three steps:

1. Statistically weighted lists of collocates of the 
target domain lemma Europe are calculated and 
screened for candidates of metaphorical lan-
guage use (5.1).
# Para 235 4
2. For the obtained candidate collocates, the cor-
pus is concordanced in order to discriminate us-
ages and assign a source domain to each collo-
cate (5.2).
# Para 239 3
3. The source domains are extended lexically, 
making use of EuroWordNet synsets and rela-
tions (5.3).
# Para 242 4
Corpus data drives the discovery of relevant lemmas 
in step 1. In steps 2 and 3, the corpus is used to 
increasingly refine and evaluate findings regarding 
relevant lemmas and source domains.

often preceded by an article and sometimes by an 
additional preposition. Based on this insight, we 
heuristically restrict the context range for collocates 
to four (i.e. three words are allowed to occur be-
tween it and Europe). For example, m`ere ‘mother’ 
in Example (1) is retained as a collocate:
(1) Parce qu’elle a ´et´e la m`ere4 fondatrice3 del 
l1’Europe unie. (‘Because she [i.e. France] 
# Para 301 4
has been the founding mother of the unified 
Europe.’)
The minimum absolute frequency of the collocate 
within the specified context range is set to 3, which 
# Para 305 5
ensures results of at least three example sentences 
per co-occurring lemma. Intentionally, no restriction 
is applied to the part of speech of the collocate.
For both sub-corpora, lists of the top 100 collo-
cate lemmas for Europe are calculated in the Man-
# Para 310 11
atee/Bonito corpus manager. We use the MI-score 
for ranking; it is based on the relative frequency of 
the co-occurring lemmas. Choosing MI-score over 
T-score is driven by an interest in salient collocates 
of Europe, whether or not they are common in the 
entire corpus. (T-score would tend to prefer collo-
cates that occur frequently throughout the corpus.) 
The top collocates and their MI-scores are given in 
Tables 4 and 5.
MI-scores of the 100 top-ranked collocates are be-
tween 7.297 and 4.575 in the Monde corpus and be-
# Para 321 5
tween 7.591 and 4.591 in the Figaro corpus. Em-
pirically, a threshold of MI &gt;= 6 retains the most 
salient collocates of Europe in both corpora. These

# Para 327 1
are 26 collocate lemmas from Le Monde and 20 from 
# Para 328 1
Le Figaro.
# Para 329 2
These highly salient collocates are evaluated for 
the potential of being used metaphorically in the tar-
# Para 331 10
get domain. The guideline underlying this evalua-
tion is as follows: Those lexemes which, in at least 
one of their usages, designate entities belonging to 
domains more concrete than POLITICS (for exam-
ple, BUILDING or FAMILY) are likely to be used 
metaphorically in the corpus. Specifically, among 
those collocates with MI &gt;= 6, we identify the 
following metaphor candidates:
Le Monde panne - ‘breakdown’, r´eveil - ‘awak-
ening; alarm clock’, construire - ‘construct’, 
# Para 341 4
otage - ‘hostage’, bˆatir - ‘build’, m`ere - 
‘mother’, r´evolte - ‘revolt’;
Le Figaro panne, bouc - ‘goat’, ruine - ‘ruin’, tra-
verser - ‘traverse’, racine - ‘root’, visage - 
# Para 345 3
‘face’, reconstruire - ‘reconstruct’.
Merging the lists yields 13 distinct candidate words, 
which are now evaluated based on contexts from 
# Para 348 9
within the corpus. There are a total of 112 occur-
rences of these lemmas co-occurring with Europe in 
a range of 4, the setting used to calculate collocate 
lists. Each of them is inspected in a context of at 
least one sentence. An annotator decides whether 
the usage is metaphorical, and confirms this in al-
most all of the cases (cf. Table 6).

# Para 443 1
tus of source domain in a conceptual mapping, a

conceptual domain should be instantiated systemat-

as long as this systematicity has not been verified, 
the assigned source domains are tentative.
Four tentative source domains are postulated, 
two of which might need to be split into subdo-

mains. The general domains are BUILDING, MO-
TION, FIGHT, and LIVING BEING. Verbs (.V) and

ous) lemmas from the Top-100 collocate list sup-
porting the source domains. Observations regarding

number of lexical metaphor instantiations. The am-
# Para 469 1
biguity of ruine - ‘ruin’, however, is unresolvable: 
# Para 470 8
The texts talk about “ruins of Europe” after World 
War II; if understood as “ruins of cities/buildings in 
Europe,” all of these occurrences are literal, but if 
interpreted as “ruins of the European political sys-
tem,” all of them are metaphorical. The ambiguity 
might be deliberate.
Also the MOTION domain has been assigned to 
a large number of disambiguated occurrences. The 
# Para 478 7
noun panne - ‘breakdown’ might instantiate a sub- 
domain, such as (MOTION IN A) MOTORIZED VEHI-
CLE; in some cases, it has been assigned MACHINE 
as source domain, purposely underspecified as to its 
motion-relatedness.
The LIVING BEING source domain is multi-
faceted, comprising PROCREATION, BODY, and 
# Para 485 19
REST, obviously personifying Europe. However, the 
frequency of lexical metaphors in these domains is 
in large part due to recurring quotations: For ex-
ample, m`ere - ‘mother’ is used exclusively within 
the expression la m`ere fondatrice de l’Europe - ‘the 
founding mother of Europe,’ attributed to J. L. Ro-
driguez Zapatero; and r´eveil - ‘awakening; alarm 
clock’ (pointing to an action of a living being) oc-
curs only as part of the expression sonner le r´eveil 
de l’Europe - ‘ring the awakening/alarm of Europe,’ 
coined by Ph. de Villiers. Finally, bouc - ‘goat’ is 
always part of the idiom le bouc ´emissaire - ‘scape-
goat’. Although it could be grouped under LIVING 
BEING, this expression is based on particular cul-
tural knowledge rather than on systematic exploita-
tion of general world knowledge about the source 
domain.
The FIGHT domain has the lowest count of lexical 
metaphors in the annotated co-occurrences of Eu-
# Para 504 6
rope. Also, the noun otage - ‘hostage’ occurs three 
times out of five within the expression (ne pas) pren-
dre l’Europe en otage - ‘(not) take Europe hostage,’ 
coined by N. Sarkozy and quoted as such.
To summarize, we observe that the most salient 
lexical metaphors co-occurring with Europe in the 
# Para 510 8
European Constitution corpus either refer to the 
source domains of BUILDING or MOTION, well- 
known source domains of conventional metaphors, 
or the lexical metaphors are sparse, referring to 
much less clearly delimited source domains such as 
LIVING BEING or FIGHT. Within the second group,
9
there are a number of newly coined expressions, 
# Para 518 1
“one shot rich image metaphors,” (Lakoff, 1987) 
# Para 519 5
which evoke entire scenes but do not necessarily 
contribute to a wide-spread systematic exploitation 
of the source domain.
5.3 Lexical extension
Corpus annotation is now extended to a larger list 
# Para 524 1
of lemmas from the source domains of BUILDING 
# Para 525 15
and MOTION. The challenge here is finding addi-
tional lemmas that might exploit the postulated map-
pings, given a small set of disambiguated lemmas 
and ambiguous collocates (cf. Table 7). A lexical 
resource for French containing information on con-
ceptual domains would be helpful here. EuroWord-
Net (EWN) could go in this direction. It defines 
many relation types, including the synonym relation 
inside synsets, as well as hyponym, near-antonym 
and meronym relations between synsets. Apart from 
these lexical relations, EWN also recognizes a fam-
ily of semantico-conceptual INVOLVED relations, 
which relate a verb synset Y to a noun synset X if
“X is the one/that who/which is typically involved 
in Ying” (Vossen, 1999) (our emphasis). Unfortu-
# Para 540 4
nately, there are almost no actual instantiations of 
INVOLVED relations in the French part of EWN.
Taking our previously identified collocates of Eu-
rope as seeds, we extend our lemma list resorting to 
# Para 544 3
EuroWordNet synsets, as follows:
•	lemmas in synsets lexically related by EWN re-
lations to synsets containing our seed lemmas 
# Para 547 3
(hypo-, hyper-, anto-, mero- and synonyms);
•	lemmas in synsets lexically related across 
part of speech to synsets containing our seed 
# Para 550 5
lemmas, by adding missing XPOS NEAR- 
SYNONYM and XPOS NEAR ANTONYM 
relations ourselves;
•	lemmas in synsets that are conceptually related 
to the seed synsets, by adding INVOLVED re-
# Para 555 3
lations ourselves.
A reiteration of these steps (using encountered 
lemmas as new seeds) could lead very soon to gen-
# Para 558 5
eral or peripheral lemmas. Ideally, one would set 
up a limit of reiteration per operation and consider 
all encountered lemmas as possible keywords of the 
domain. However, annotator resources being lim-
ited, we reduced the list of key lemmas to about 20 
# Para 563 4
per domain (22 for BUILDING and 19 for MOTION), 
using human judgment.
At this stage, the restriction on the keyword of 
being a collocate of Europe is lifted. This results 
# Para 567 10
in search, disambiguation, and annotation being per-
formed on the entire corpus. The annotator finds 663 
lexical metaphors among the 1,237 occurrences of 
22 BUILDING keywords, and 409 lexical metaphors 
among the 1,307 occurrences of 19 MOTION key-
words. Each key lemma contributes positively to the 
count of lexical metaphors. Two consequences fol-
low from these figures:
1. Both postulated source domains are systemati-
cally exploited by lexical metaphors.
# Para 577 2
2. Every second or third investigated occurrence 
is a lexical metaphor.5 Collection and annota-
# Para 579 5
tion of metaphors can thus proceed consider-
ably faster on the key lemmas than it would on 
full text or randomly selected sentences.
For each lexical metaphor, the annotator provides 
EuroWordNet synset information. For the actual 
# Para 584 6
meaning in context, the synset belonging to the tar-
get domain is encoded. Additionally, the synset con-
taining the metaphorically used lexeme in its source 
domain sense is indicated (“source synset”).
6 Source domain structure
The information on source synsets underlies con-
# Para 590 1
ceptual maps of the two source domains. This is 
# Para 591 11
exemplified here by Figure 1, which represents the 
MOTION domain. Lexical metaphors are prefixed 
by M ; those word senses not encoded in EWN are 
marked with an asterisk at the end. Synsets shaded 
gray in Figure 1 contain at least one lemma that is 
exploited as a lexical metaphor, and as such attested 
in the European Constitution corpus. Ovals rep-
resent verb synsets, boxes show noun synsets, and 
hexagons depict events.
Relations between synsets illustrate the internal 
structure of the domain. Solid lines represent rela-
# Para 602 4
tions encoded in EuroWordNet. For legibility rea-
sons, labels of hyponym relations have been omitted.
5In the vicinity of Europe, the ratio continues to be higher, 
with at least three quarters of the contexts being metaphorical.

Figure 1: The MOTION source domain with corpus-specific highlights.
Dotted lines stand for relations that we added. These 
# Para 703 1
were labeled using EWN relation types (Vossen, 
# Para 704 9
1999), where possible. As obvious from Figure 1, 
the domain graph would be separate partitions with-
out our additional relations, especially those of 
the INVOLVED type. Conceptual relations (“typi-
cally... ”) are thus a necessary addition to lexical re-
lations (“necessarily...”) in order to represent con-
ceptual source domains.
The map representing the source domain is a re-
sult of our corpus investigation of this specific tar-
# Para 713 11
get domain corpus. The structure of the source do-
main is not intended to be a general representation of 
this domain, nor does it imply fixed domain bound-
aries. Rather, the network shows the elements of the 
source domain that mapped onto the target domain 
from corpus attestations. If the same source domain 
were to be mapped onto some other target domain, 
other synsets might be used. A lexico-conceptual re-
source encoding general information on this source 
domain would thus have to contain more synsets and 
relations than those displayed in Figure 1.
# Para 724 2
The choice of source domains as well as of cer-
tain lexical items from within a source domain has 
# Para 726 5
the effect of “highlighting and hiding” certain as-
pects of the target domain. For example, among 
the numerous hyponyms of the central ‘move’ synset
{se d´eplacer: 1 se mouvoir:1 aller: 3}–most of which
are not displayed in Figure 1–, the European Con-
# Para 731 1
stitution corpus shows a tendency towards lexi-
# Para 732 12
cal metaphors in synsets containing the verb tra-
verser - ‘traverse’. This profiles the path compo-
nent of the motion event. The path itself is fur-
ther emphasized by lexical metaphors related to 
the ‘move’ synset by INVOLVED LOCATION and 
INVOLVED DIRECTION. Also vehicles as instru-
ments play a role in the conceptualization, but not 
all vehicles have metaphorical attestations in the cor-
pus: only train - ‘train’ and bateau - ‘boat’ are found 
during a cross-check. Finally, synsets referring to
11
the contrary of ‘move’ are contained within the map 
# Para 744 1
of the source domain. Even the ‘motor’ (as a vehi-
# Para 745 5
cle part) and its ‘breakdown’ (causing ‘immobiliza-
tion’) are thus lexically and conceptually integrated 
in the MOTION domain derived from our corpus.
All these highlightings and hidings can be inter-
preted with respect to the situation of Europe before 
# Para 750 7
the referendum on its Constitution: Europe is made 
cognitively accessible as a multi-passenger vehicle 
in motion on a path, which has not yet arrived but is 
facing obstacles to its motion, possibly resulting in 
being stopped.
7 Conclusion and Outlook
A method for quickly finding large amounts of lex-
# Para 757 1
ical metaphors and characterizing their source do-
# Para 758 11
mains has been exemplified, given a target domain 
corpus. The method makes use of collocate explo-
ration of a target domain keyword, in order to iden-
tify the most promising source domains. Over 1,000 
manual annotations have been obtained and will be 
integrated into the Hamburg Metaphor Database. 
This outnumbers by far the results of previous stud-
ies filed within HMD, which originated under simi-
lar conditions but did not resort to a corpus manager.
Our method is different from automated work on 
metaphor recognition such as (Mason, 2004) and 
# Para 769 10
(Gedigian et al., 2006) in that it includes nouns as 
parts of speech. Implementing it in an automated 
system would require more sophisticated lexical- 
conceptual resources, representing information on 
concrete domains (possible source domains). In par-
ticular, the addition of lexical and conceptual links 
between verb and noun synsets is crucial for estab-
lishing a connected source domain graph.
