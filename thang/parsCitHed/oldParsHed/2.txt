<abstract>Copy and move operations have long been supported by interactive desktops through various means. But the growing number of on-screen objects makes these means harder to use. In this note, we present new tools and techniques to enhance the existing ones: a selection, copy and drag history manager; two techniques to expose the userâ€™s desk and leaf through stacks of overlapping windows; and a technique that integrates the previous two with conventional drag-anddrop.
