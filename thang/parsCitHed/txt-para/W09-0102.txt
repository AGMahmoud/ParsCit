Abstract
# Para 5 7
Without lengthy, iterative refinement of 
guidelines, and equally lengthy and itera-
tive training of annotators, the level of in-
ter-subjective agreement on simple tasks 
of phonetic, phonological, syntactic, se-
mantic, and pragmatic annotation is 
shockingly low.
# Para 12 5
This is a significant practical problem in 
speech and language technology, but it 
poses questions of interest to psycholo-
gists, philosophers of language, and theo-
retical linguists as well.

1 Introduction
# Para 18 10
Biologists believe that they know what 
genes, organisms, chemical compounds, 
and diseases are. Linguists believe that 
they know what nouns, verbs, and claus-
es are. Ordinary literate speakers of En-
glish believe that they know what people, 
places, and organizations are. And all of 
them believe that they can recognize and 
understand instances of these categories 
in coherent text.
# Para 28 8
When two biologists, two linguists, or 
two English speakers discuss such texts, 
it seems plausible that they have under-
stood such instances in the same way. 
Nevertheless, if they are asked to high-
light these instances, the level of inter- 
subjective agreement will be shockingly 
low.
# Para 36 5
Similarly depressing results are obtained 
in tasks such as phonetic or surface- 
phonemic transcription, co-reference an-
notation, identification of animacy, etc. 
Things are usually not much better if we
# Para 41 2
compare annotations produced by the 
same individuals on different occasions.
# Para 43 10
A solution exists, in the practical sense of 
producing annotations with high inter-an-
notator agreement scores. The initially- 
divergent results of multiple annotations 
are discussed and adjudicated, and princi-
ples of interpretation are defined for fu-
ture use. This process is repeated over 
and over again, typically for several 
months, until the desired level of agree-
ment is obtained, or funding runs out.
# Para 53 12
At least for simple linguistic annotation 
tasks, this process, reminiscent of the de-
velopment of common law, generally 
converges (though the residual level of 
disagreement may be depressingly high, 
especially when multiple judgments must 
be cascaded). The resulting annotation 
manuals may be hundreds of pages long, 
even for fairly limited tasks; and new an-
notators face weeks or months of training 
to become competent in learning to apply 
them.
# Para 65 13
There are several obvious ideas about 
why this might be true, but most of these 
ideas seem to be false. It will be argued 
that part of the answer lies in understand-
ing that most linguistic annotation tasks 
are not really classification problems, but 
rather translation problems. We don’t 
normally assume that there is only one 
correct translation of a Chinese sentence 
into English; nor do we try to make this 
true by constructing elaborate translation 
guidelines to cover every relevant contin-
gency, though in principle we could.

Implications in engineering and science 
will be discussed.
