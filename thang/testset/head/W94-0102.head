However, linguists developing these lin- +L+ guistic resources have used quite different wordtagging +L+ and parse-tree labelling schemes in each of these anno- +L+ tated corpora. This restricts the accessibility of each +L+ corpus, making it impossible for speech and handwrit- +L+ ing researchers to collate them into a single very large +L+ training set. This is particularly problematic as there +L+ is evidence that one of these parsed corpora on its own +L+ is too small for a general statistical model of grammat- +L+ ical structure, but the combined size of all the above +L+ annotated corpora should deliver a much more reliable +L+ model. +L+ We are developing a set of mapping algorithms to +L+ map between the main tagsets and phrase structure +L+ grammar schemes used in the above corpora. We plan +L+ to develop a Multi-tagged Corpus and a MultiTreebank, +L+ a single text-set annotated with all the above tagging +L+ and parsing schemes. The text-set is the Spoken En- +L+ glish Corpus: this is a half-way house between formal +L+ written text and colloquial conversational speech. How- +L+ ever, the main deliverable to the computational linguis- +L+ tics research community is not the SEC-based Multi- +L+ Treebank, but the mapping suite used to produce it +L+ - this can be used to combine currently-incompatible +L+ syntactic training sets into a large unified multicorpus. +L+ Our architecture combines standard statistical language +L+ modelling and a rule-base derived from linguists' anal- +L+ yses of tagset-mappings, in a novel yet intuitive way. +L+ Our development of the mapping algorithms aims to +L+ distinguish notational from substantive differences in +L+ the annotation schemes, and we will be able to evalu- +L+ ate tagging schemes in terms of how well they fit stan- +L+ dard statistical language models such as n-pos (Markov) +L+ models. 1 </abstract><note>+L+ 1This research began with grants from the UK Science +L+ and Engineering Research Council (SERC) and the Univer- +L+ sities Funding Council's Knowledge Based Systems Initia- +L+ tive (UFC KBSI), and is now funded by the UK Engineer- +L+ ing and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC) and +L+ </note></variant>
