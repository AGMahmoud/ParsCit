We inves- +L+ tigated the regional variation of lexical +L+ items in two specific domains, finance +L+ and sports; and explored how much of +L+ such variation is covered in existing Chi- +L+ nese synonym dictionaries, in particular +L+ the Tongyici Cilin. The domain-specific +L+ lexical items were obtained from subsec- +L+ tions of a synchronous Chinese corpus, +L+ LIVAC. Results showed that 20-40% of +L+ the words from various subcorpora are +L+ unique to the individual communities, +L+ and as much as 70% of such unique items +L+ are not yet covered in the Tongyici Cilin. +L+ The results suggested great potential for +L+ building a Pan-Chinese lexical resource +L+ for Chinese language processing. Our +L+ next step would be to explore automatic +L+ means for extracting related lexical items +L+ from the corpus, and to incorporate them +L+ into existing semantic classifications. +L+ </abstract></variant>
