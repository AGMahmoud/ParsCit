By contrast, another equally important +L+ factor involved in reference assignment, +L+ namely, accessibility of contextual +L+ assumptions, seems to have not been +L+ addressed fully as a part of a computational +L+ theory of reference. In the field of pragmatics, +L+ however, the role of context has always been +L+ one of the central issues and the recent +L+ approach to context selection based on the +L+ notion of relevance (Sperber &amp; Wilson +L+ 1986/1995) seems to be currently the most +L+ promising. In this paper, I will review and +L+ assess the recent centering approach to the +L+ interpretation of Japanese zero pronouns +L+ (Walker et al. 1994) as a case study, and +L+ suggest that relevance theory can provide one +L+ way of complementing it. In order •to +L+ incorporate a needed mechanism of contextual +L+ selection into a model of reference assignment, +L+ model builders must take into account the +L+ heater's ability to anticipate certain cognitive +L+ effects that may be achieved by upcoming +L+ utterances. It is my hope that </abstract><note>this paper will +L+ lead to a fruitful discussion of finding possible +L+ ways of using Sperber &amp; Wilson-'s notion of +L+ relevance in practical applications. +L+ </note></variant>
