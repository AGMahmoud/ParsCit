We demonstrate that this +L+ intuition can be made concrete by using the formal- +L+ ism of synchronous tree-adjoining grammars. The use +L+ of synchronous TAGs for generation provides solutions +L+ to several problems with previous approaches to TAG +L+ generation. Furthermore, the semantic monotonicity +L+ requirement previously advocated for generation gram- +L+ mars as a computational aid is seen to be an inherent +L+ property of synchronous TAGs. +L+ </abstract></variant>
