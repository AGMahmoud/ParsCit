We show that it provides more +L+ uniform, expressive and efficient tools for parsing +L+ and generating language. Next, we present two +L+ abstract machines which enable us to design, in a +L+ symmetric way, a parser and a generator from that +L+ formalism. This abstract machinery is then +L+ exemplified by a detailed study of secondary +L+ predication within the framework of a principled- +L+ based description of language: Government and +L+ Binding theory. +L+ </abstract></variant>
