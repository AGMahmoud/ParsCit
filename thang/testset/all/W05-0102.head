We have a new appreciation +L+ for the differences between coursework +L+ and research infrastructure—supporting +L+ teaching may be harder, because students +L+ require a broader spectrum of implemen- +L+ tation, a faster learning curve and the abil- +L+ ity to explore mistaken ideas as well as +L+ promising ones. We outline the collabo- +L+ rative discussion and effort we think is re- +L+ quired to create better teaching infrastruc- +L+ ture in the future. +L+ </abstract></variant>
