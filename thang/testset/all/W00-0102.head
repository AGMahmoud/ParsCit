Our method follows +L+ from an analysis indicating that long runs of +L+ content words appear in a stopped document +L+ cluster, and our observation that these long +L+ runs predominately originate from the +L+ prepositional phrase and subject +L+ complement positions and as such, may be +L+ useful predictors of semantic coherence. +L+ From this linguistic basis, we test three +L+ statistical hypotheses over a small collection +L+ of documents from different genre. By +L+ coordinating thesaurus semantic categories +L+ (SEMCATs) of the long run words to the +L+ semantic categories of paragraphs, we +L+ conclude that for paragraphs containing both +L+ long runs and short runs, the SEMCAT +L+ weight of long runs of content words is a +L+ strong predictor of the semantic coherence +L+ of the paragraph. +L+ </abstract></variant>
