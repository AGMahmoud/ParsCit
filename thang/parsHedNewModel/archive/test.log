The problem of collecting responses in multi-hop radio networks is considered. A given node, called the source, is to collect a specified number of	abstract	abstract
+L+
responses from nodes in a radio network. The problem arises in several	abstract	abstract
+L+
applications of distributed systems. A deterministic and a randomized protocol for the problem are presented. The two protocols are analyzed and	abstract	abstract
+L+
their performance is compared. Conclusions are drawn about the suitability	abstract	abstract
+L+
of our protocols in various network environments.	abstract	abstract

Abstract: How do we formally specify the relation between a base class and a	abstract	abstract
+L+
derived class? This question has two parts, a syntactic one, and a semantic one.	abstract	abstract
+L+
The syntactic part is of course the easier of the two and the answer to that part is	abstract	abstract
+L+
the standard contra/co- variance requirement on the arguments and result of any	abstract	abstract
+L+
base class method redefined in the derived class. Our concern in the current paper	abstract	abstract
+L+
is with the semantic part of the question, i.e., how do we specify the behavioral	abstract	abstract
+L+
relation between the base class and the derived class? We show that the standard	abstract	abstract
+L+
answer -which is the semantic counterpart of contra/co-variance- is too rigid, and	abstract	abstract
+L+
does not allow some natural and common forms of inheritance. We then propose a	abstract	abstract
+L+
more flexible way to specify the relation, and show how different types of behavioral relations between base classes and derived classes may be specified using our	abstract	abstract
+L+
notation.	abstract	abstract

Recent advances in the Domain Name System (DNS) and the Dynamic Host Configuration	abstract	abstract

Protocol (DHCP) have enabled a new approach to supporting mobile users: location independent	abstract	abstract

naming. In this approach, machines use the same hostname from any internet location, but use an	abstract	abstract
+L+
IP address that corresponds to their current location. We describe a protocol that implements	abstract	abstract
+L+
location independent naming for nomadic computers, i.e., machines that do not need transparent	abstract	abstract
+L+
mobility. Our protocol allows hosts to move across security domains, uses existing protocols, and	abstract	abstract

preserves existing trust relationships. Therefore, it preserves the performance and security of	abstract	abstract

normal IP for nomadic computers at the expense of not providing the transparent mobility of	abstract	abstract

Mobile IP. We contend that this is a reasonable tradeoff for nomadic computing.	abstract	abstract

Abstract	abstract	abstract
+L+
Shape modeling is an important constituent of computer vision as well as computer graphics	abstract	abstract
+L+
research. Shape models aid the tasks of object representation and recognition. This paper	abstract	abstract
+L+
presents a new approach to shape modeling which retains some of the attractive features of	abstract	abstract
+L+
existing methods, and overcomes some of their limitations. Our techniques can be applied to	abstract	abstract
+L+
model arbitrarily complex shapes, which include shapes with significant protrusions, and to	abstract	abstract
+L+
situations where no a priori assumption about the object's topology is made. A single instance	abstract	abstract
+L+
of our model, when presented with an image having more than one object of interest, has the	abstract	abstract
+L+
ability to split freely to represent each object. This method is based on the ideas developed	abstract	abstract
+L+
by Osher and Sethian to model propagating solid/liquid interfaces with curvature-dependent	abstract	abstract
+L+
speeds. The interface (front) is a closed, nonintersecting, hypersurface flowing along its gradient	abstract	abstract
+L+
field with constant speed or a speed that depends on the curvature. It is moved by solving a	abstract	abstract
+L+
"Hamilton-Jacobi" type equation written for a function in which the interface is a particular	abstract	abstract
+L+
level set. A speed term synthesized from the image is used to stop the interface in the vicinity of	abstract	abstract
+L+
object boundaries. The resulting equation of motion is solved by employing entropy-satisfying	abstract	abstract
+L+
upwind finite difference schemes. We present a variety of ways of computing evolving front,	abstract	abstract
+L+
including narrow bands, reinitializations, and different stopping criteria. The efficacy of the	abstract	abstract
+L+
scheme is demonstrated with numerical experiments on some synthesized images and some low	abstract	abstract
+L+
contrast medical images.	abstract	abstract

This paper describes the application of Parallel Distributed Genetic Programming (PDGP) to the problem of inducing programs for natural language processing.	abstract	abstract

PDGP is a new form of Genetic Programming (GP) which is suitable for the development of programs with a high degree of parallelism and an efficient and effective	abstract	abstract

reuse of partial results. Programs are represented in PDGP as graphs with nodes	abstract	abstract
+L+
representing functions and terminals, and links representing the flow of control and	abstract	abstract

results. PDGP allows the exploration of a large space of possible programs including standard tree-like programs, logic networks, neural networks, finite state	abstract	abstract

automata, Recursive Transition Networks (RTNs), etc. The paper describes the	abstract	abstract

representations, the operators and the interpreters used in PDGP, and illustrates	abstract	abstract

In this position paper we raise the question of whether Configuration Management (CM)	abstract	abstract

such as Adele, ADC, ClearCase, Continuus/CM, and CCC/Harvest|largely satisfies the CM	abstract	abstract

unnecessary or that we must find new challenges in CM on which to focus. We believe that	abstract	abstract

these challenges indeed exist. Here we present some areas that we feel are good opportunities	abstract	abstract

for new or continued CM research, and therefore conclude that CM research does have a future.	abstract	abstract

We propose a new algorithm for computing the Riemann mapping of the	abstract	abstract

unit disk to a polygon, also known as the Schwarz-Christoffel transformation.	abstract	abstract
+L+
The new algorithm, CRDT, is based on cross-ratios of the prevertices, and also	abstract	abstract
+L+
on cross-ratios of quadrilaterals in a Delaunay triangulation of the polygon.	abstract	abstract
+L+
The CRDT algorithm produces an accurate representation of the Riemann	abstract	abstract
+L+
mapping even in the presence of arbitrary long, thin regions in the polygon,	abstract	abstract
+L+
unlike any previous conformal mapping algorithm. We believe that CRDT can	abstract	abstract
+L+
never fail to converge to the correct Riemann mapping, but the correctness and	abstract	abstract
+L+
convergence proof depend on conjectures that we have so far not been able to	abstract	abstract
+L+
prove. We demonstrate convergence with computational experiments.	abstract	abstract
+L+
The Riemann mapping has applications to problems in two-dimensional	abstract	abstract

potential theory and to finite-difference mesh generation. We use CRDT to	abstract	abstract

produce a mapping and solve a boundary value problem on long, thin regions	abstract	abstract

The Two-Level Hypermedia Paradigm sees an	abstract	abstract

Information Retrieval System as consisting of	abstract	abstract

a document network (the Hyperbase) and a	abstract	abstract

descriptor (term) network (the Hyperindex).	abstract	abstract
+L+
Query by Navigation is a process whereby the	abstract	abstract

searcher gives a description of the Information Need by travelling through the descriptor	abstract	abstract

network. This paper presents a formalism for	abstract	abstract
+L+
expressing the effects of traversing the Hyper-index on the elements of the Hyperindex. This	abstract	abstract
+L+
formalism makes use of probabilities for mod-elling the searcher's behavious. The events	abstract	abstract
+L+
which can occur during the search process	abstract	abstract
+L+
are discussed and modelled. Some important	abstract	abstract
+L+
properties, which are reasonable to demand of	abstract	abstract
+L+
a retrieval system, can be proven to be valid	abstract	abstract
+L+
if this formalism is adopted. A mechanism	abstract	abstract

mentioned above. An example will show the	abstract	abstract

Abstract	abstract	abstract
+L+
Several researchers have proposed modeling	abstract	abstract
+L+
temporally abstract actions in reinforcement	abstract	abstract
+L+
learning by the combination of a policy and a termination condition, which we refer to as an option. Value functions over options and models of	abstract	abstract
+L+
options can be learned using methods designed	abstract	abstract
+L+
for semi-Markov decision processes (SMDPs).	abstract	abstract
+L+
However, all these methods require an option to	abstract	abstract
+L+
be executed to termination. In this paper we explore methods that learn about an option from	abstract	abstract
+L+
small fragments of experience consistent with	abstract	abstract
+L+
that option, even if the option itself is not executed. We call these methods intra-option learning methods because they learn from experience	abstract	abstract
+L+
within an option. Intra-option methods are sometimes much more efficient than SMDP methods because they can use off-policy temporal-difference mechanisms to learn simultaneously	abstract	abstract
+L+
about all the options consistent with an experience, not just the few that were actually executed. In this paper we present intra-option learning methods for learning value functions over options and for learning multi-time models of the	abstract	abstract
+L+
consequences of options. We present computational examples in which these new methods	abstract	abstract
+L+
learn much faster than SMDP methods and learn	abstract	abstract
+L+
effectively when SMDP methods cannot learn at	abstract	abstract
+L+
all. We also sketch a convergence proof for intra	abstract	abstract
+L+
option value learning.	abstract	abstract

Abstract	abstract	abstract
+L+
Traditional inter-domain routing protocols based on superdomains maintain either "strong"	abstract	abstract
+L+
or "weak" ToS and policy constraints for each visible superdomain. With strong constraints,	abstract	abstract
+L+
a valid path may not be found even though one exists. With weak constraints, an invalid	abstract	abstract
+L+
domain-level path may be treated as a valid path.	abstract	abstract
+L+
We present an inter-domain routing protocol based on superdomains, which always finds	abstract	abstract
+L+
a valid path if one exists. Both strong and weak constraints are maintained for each visible	abstract	abstract
+L+
superdomain. If the strong constraints of the superdomains on a path are satisfied, then the	abstract	abstract
+L+
path is valid. If only the weak constraints are satisfied for some superdomains on the path, the	abstract	abstract
+L+
source uses a query protocol to obtain a more detailed "internal" view of these superdomains,	abstract	abstract
+L+
and searches again for a valid path. Our protocol handles topology changes, including node/link	abstract	abstract
+L+
failures that partition superdomains. Evaluation results indicate our protocol scales well to large	abstract	abstract

The relation between the orthography and the phonology of a language has	abstract	abstract

is a well-known problem for many ML algorithms. We present experiments	abstract	abstract

are applied to a small corpus of Scottish Gaelic. instance-based learning in the	abstract	abstract

Abstract	abstract	abstract
+L+
Nested loop execution of object-oriented queries retains	abstract	abstract
+L+
the promise of maintaining the full generality of the object paradigm, independent of the specifics of any single	abstract	abstract
+L+
object model. Thus, from this starting point we have	abstract	abstract
+L+
developed an object-oriented query optimizer and execution engine. The methods, developed to date for only	abstract	abstract
+L+
acyclic queries, augment nested loops structures with a	abstract	abstract
+L+
simple marking mechanism such that unnecessary loop	abstract	abstract
+L+
iterations are not repeated. In the case of acyclic queries,	abstract	abstract
+L+
the executions are asymptotically optimal. In contrast to	abstract	abstract
+L+
optimal query methods based on semijoin reductions our	abstract	abstract
+L+
method involves no preprocessing step and thus avoids	abstract	abstract
+L+
the extra I/O associated with semijoins and prevents the	abstract	abstract
+L+
formal benefits of semijoin reduction from appearing as a	abstract	abstract
+L+
practical improvement. Empirical results comparing our	abstract	abstract
+L+
query environment with a commercially available product	abstract	abstract
+L+
demonstrate significant performance improvement.	abstract	abstract

combines artificial neural networks to achieve expert-	abstract	abstract

level accuracy on the difficult scientific task of recognizing volcanos in radar images of the surface of the	abstract	abstract

When Plannett is used as the classification module	abstract	abstract

of a three-stage image analysis system called JAR-	abstract	abstract

Abstract. Evolving algebras (EAs) as defined by Yuri Gurevich constitute the basis of a powerful and elegant specification and verification	abstract	abstract
+L+
method which has successfully been applied to the design and analysis of	abstract	abstract
+L+
various kinds of discrete dynamic systems. Aiming at the development	abstract	abstract
+L+
of a comprehensive EA-based specification and design environment, we	abstract	abstract
+L+
introduce the concept of an evolving algebra abstract machine (EAM ) as	abstract	abstract
+L+
a platform for the systematic development of EA tools; for instance, as	abstract	abstract
+L+
required for machine based analysis and execution of EA specifications.	abstract	abstract
+L+
We give a formal definition of the EAM ground model in terms of a	abstract	abstract
+L+
universal evolving algebra, where we validate the correctness of the relation between evolving algebras (their theoretical foundations) and their	abstract	abstract
+L+
EAM representation and interpretation. Our approach covers sequential	abstract	abstract

as well as distributed evolving algebras.	abstract	abstract

Efficient path query processing is a key requirement for advanced	abstract	abstract

database applications including GIS (Geographic Information Systems) and ITS (Intelligent Transportation Systems). We study the	abstract	abstract
+L+
problem in the context of automobile navigation systems where a	abstract	abstract
+L+
large number of path requests can be submitted over the transportation network within a short period of time. To guarantee efficient re-sponsefor path queries, we employ a path view materialization strategy for precomputing the best paths. We tackle the following three	abstract	abstract
+L+
issues: (1) memory-resident solutions quickly exceed current computer storage capacity for networks of thousands of nodes, (2) disk-based solutions have been found inefficient to meet the stringent	abstract	abstract
+L+
performance requirements, and (3) path views become too costly	abstract	abstract
+L+
to update for large graphs. We propose the HEP V (Hierarchical	abstract	abstract

guaranteeing the optimality of path retrieval. Our experimental results reveal that HEP V is more efficient than previously known	abstract	abstract

We present algorithms for the randomized simulation of a shared memory machine	abstract	abstract
+L+
(PRAM) on a Distributed Memory Machine (DMM). In a PRAM, memory conflicts	abstract	abstract
+L+
occur only through concurrent access to the same cell, whereas the memory of a	abstract	abstract
+L+
DMM is divided into modules, one for each processor, and concurrent accesses to	abstract	abstract
+L+
the same module create a conflict. The delay of a simulation is the time needed to	abstract	abstract
+L+
simulate a parallel memory access of the PRAM. Any general simulation of an m	abstract	abstract
+L+
processor PRAM on a n processor DMM will necessarily have delay at least m=n. A	abstract	abstract
+L+
randomized simulation is called time-processor optimal if the delay is O(m=n) with	abstract	abstract
+L+
high probability. Using a novel simulation scheme based on hashing we obtain a	abstract	abstract
+L+
time-processor optimal simulation with delay O(loglog(n)log (n)). The best previous	abstract	abstract

simulations use a simpler scheme based on hashing and have much larger delay:	abstract	abstract

fi(log(n)= loglog(n)) for the simulation of an n processor PRAM on an n processor	abstract	abstract

DMM, and fi(log(n)) in the case where the simulation is time-processor optimal.	abstract	abstract

Abstract	abstract	abstract
+L+
Real-Time reliable multicast over a best-effort service network remains a challenging research problem. Most	abstract	abstract
+L+
protocols for reliable multicast use repair techniques that result in significant and variable delay, which can lead to	abstract	abstract
+L+
missed deadlines in real-time scenarios. This paper presents a repair technique that combines forward error correction	abstract	abstract
+L+
(FEC) with automatic repeat request (ARQ). The novel aspect of the technique is its ability to reduce delay in reliable	abstract	abstract
+L+
multicast delivery by sending repairs proactively (i.e., before they are required). The technique requires minimal	abstract	abstract
+L+
state at senders and receivers, and no additional active router functionality beyond what is required by the current	abstract	abstract
+L+
multicast service model. Furthermore, the technique uses only end-to-end mechanisms, where all data and repairs are	abstract	abstract
+L+
transmitted by the data-originating source, leaving receivers free from any burden of sending repairs. We simulate	abstract	abstract
+L+
a simple round-based version of a protocol embodying this technique to show its effectiveness in preventing repair	abstract	abstract
+L+
request implosion, reducing the expected time of reliable delivery of data, and keeping bandwidth usage for repairs	abstract	abstract
+L+
low. We show how a protocol using the technique can be adapted to provide delivery that is reliable before a real-time	abstract	abstract
+L+
deadline with probabilities extremely close to one. Finally, we develop several variations of the protocol that use the	abstract	abstract
+L+
technique in various fashions for high rate data streaming applications, and present results from additional simulations	abstract	abstract
+L+
that examine performance in a variety of Internet-like heterogeneous networks.	abstract	abstract

Abstract	abstract	abstract
+L+
Current secure multiparty protocols have the following deficiency. The public transcript of the communication can be used as an involuntary commitment of the parties to their inputs and outputs. Thus	abstract	abstract
+L+
parties can be later coerced by some authority to reveal their private data. Previous work that has	abstract	abstract
+L+
pointed this interesting problem out contained only partial treatment.	abstract	abstract
+L+
In this work we present the first general and rigorous treatment of the coercion problem in secure computation. First we present a general definition of protocols that provide resilience to coercion. Our	abstract	abstract
+L+
definition constitutes a natural extension of the general paradigm used for defining secure multiparty	abstract	abstract
+L+
protocols. Next we show that if trapdoor permutations exist then any function can be incoercibly	abstract	abstract
+L+
computed (i.e., computed by a protocol that provides resilience to coercion) in the presence of com-putationally bounded adversaries and only public communication channels. This holds as long as less	abstract	abstract
+L+
than half the parties are coerced (or corrupted). In particular, ours are the first incoercible protocols	abstract	abstract
+L+
without physical assumptions. Also, our protocols constitute an alternative solution to the recently	abstract	abstract
+L+
solved adaptive security problem.	abstract	abstract
+L+
Our techniques are quite surprising and include non-standard use of deniable encryptions.	abstract	abstract

Simplicial depth is a way to measure how deep a point is among a set of points. Efficient	abstract	abstract

multivariate analysis in statistics. A straightforward method takes O(n d+1 ) time when the	abstract	abstract

points are in three-dimensional space, and we generalize it to four-dimensional space with	abstract	abstract

a time complexity of O(n 4 ). For spaces higher than four-dimensional, there are no known	abstract	abstract

The paper presents the general theory of designing multidimensional Quadrature Mirror Filters (QMF),	abstract	abstract
+L+
for use in sub-band coding (SBC) systems, using the McClellan transform [1]. It was recently shown that	abstract	abstract
+L+
McClellan transform could be used to generate 2-D diamond shape QMF filters [2]. In this paper we will	abstract	abstract

formalize the proofs of the diamond shape case, and generalize it to other shapes, sampling rasters and	abstract	abstract
+L+
dimensions.	abstract	abstract
+L+
Moreover we show that we do not really need the 1-D QMF filters: it is also possible and even more	abstract	abstract

convenient to design QMF filter banks by performing transformations on a class of real valued polynomials.	abstract	abstract
+L+
Examples are given of two dimensional diamond and fan-shape filters and three dimensional tetrad filters	abstract	abstract

Abstract	abstract	abstract
+L+
In this paper, we study the tradeoffs involved in choosing the bit allocation in a	abstract	abstract
+L+
multiresolution remote image retrieval system. Such a system uses a multiresolution	abstract	abstract
+L+
image coding scheme so that a user accessing the database will first see a coarse	abstract	abstract
+L+
version of the images and will be able to accept or discard a given image faster,	abstract	abstract
+L+
without needing to receive all the image data. We formalize the problem of choosing	abstract	abstract
+L+
the bit allocation (e.g., in the two resolution case, how many bits should be given	abstract	abstract
+L+
to the coarse image and the additional information, respectively?) so that the	abstract	abstract
+L+
overall delay in the query is minimized. We provide analytical methods to find the	abstract	abstract
+L+
optimal solution under different configurations and show how a good choice of the	abstract	abstract
+L+
bit allocation results in a significant reduction of the overall delay in the query (by	abstract	abstract
+L+
up to a factor of two in some cases).	abstract	abstract

A new generation of sensor rich, massively distributed	abstract	abstract
+L+
autonomous systems is being developed that has	abstract	abstract
+L+
the potential for unprecedented performance, such	abstract	abstract
+L+
as smart buildings, reconfigurable factories, adaptive	abstract	abstract
+L+
traffic systems and remote earth ecosystem monitoring. To achieve high performance these massive systems will need to accurately model themselves and	abstract	abstract
+L+
their environment from sensor information. Accomplishing this on a grand scale requires automating the	abstract	abstract
+L+
art of large-scale modeling. This paper presents a	abstract	abstract
+L+
formalization of decompositional, model-based learning	abstract	abstract
+L+
(DML), a method developed by observing a modeler's	abstract	abstract
+L+
expertise at decomposing large scale model estimation	abstract	abstract
+L+
tasks. The method exploits a striking analogy between	abstract	abstract
+L+
learning and consistency-based diagnosis. Moriarty,	abstract	abstract

an implementation of DML, has been applied to thermal modeling of a smart building, demonstrating a	abstract	abstract

Abstract	abstract	abstract
+L+
We describe a novel approach for image matching	abstract	abstract
+L+
based on deformable intensity surfaces. In this	abstract	abstract
+L+
approach, the intensity surface of the image	abstract	abstract
+L+
is modeled as a deformable 3D mesh in the	abstract	abstract
+L+
(x; ; I(x; )) space. Each surface point has 3	abstract	abstract
+L+
degrees of freedom, thus capturing fine surface	abstract	abstract

changes. A set of representative deformations	abstract	abstract
+L+
within a class of objects (e.g. faces) are statistically learned through a Principal Components Analysis, thus providing a priori knowledge	abstract	abstract
+L+
about object-specific deformations. We demonstrate the power of the approach by examples	abstract	abstract

such as image matching and interpolation of	abstract	abstract

Abstract. We present a new diagnostic algorithm, based on backward-propagation, for localising design	abstract	abstract
+L+
errors in combinational logic circuits. Three hypotheses are considered, that cover all single gate replacement and insertion errors. Diagnosis-oriented test patterns are generated in order to rapidly reduce the	abstract	abstract
+L+
suspected area where the error lies. The originality of our method is the use of patterns which do not	abstract	abstract
+L+
detect the error, in addition to detecting patterns. A theorem shows that, in favourable cases, only two	abstract	abstract
+L+
patterns suffice to get a correction. We have implemented the test generation and diagnosis algorithms.	abstract	abstract
+L+
Results obtained on benchmarks show that the error is always found, after the application of a small	abstract	abstract

number of test patterns, with an execution time proportional to the circuit size.	abstract	abstract

Abstract	abstract	abstract
+L+
This paper presents an approach to describing	abstract	abstract
+L+
group behavior using simple local interactions	abstract	abstract
+L+
among individuals. We propose that for a given	abstract	abstract
+L+
domain a set of basic interactions can be defined	abstract	abstract
+L+
which describes a large variety of group behaviors.	abstract	abstract
+L+
The methodology we present allows for simplified	abstract	abstract
+L+
qualitative analysis of group behavior through the	abstract	abstract
+L+
use of shared goals, kin recognition, and minimal	abstract	abstract
+L+
communication. We also demonstrate how these	abstract	abstract
+L+
basic interactions can be simply combined into	abstract	abstract
+L+
more complex compound group behaviors.	abstract	abstract
+L+
To validate our approach we implemented an array of basic group behaviors in the domain of spatial interactions among homogeneous agents. We	abstract	abstract
+L+
describe some of the experimental results from two	abstract	abstract
+L+
distinct domains: a software environment, and a	abstract	abstract
+L+
collection of 20 mobile robots. We also describe	abstract	abstract
+L+
a compound behavior involving a combination of	abstract	abstract
+L+
the basic interactions. Finally, we compare the	abstract	abstract
+L+
performance of homogeneous groups to those of	abstract	abstract
+L+
dominance hierarchies on the same set of basic behaviors.	abstract	abstract

Summary	abstract	abstract
+L+
Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) is used for evaluating expectations of functions of interest	abstract	abstract
+L+
under a target distribution . This is done by calculating averages over the sample path of a	abstract	abstract
+L+
Markov chain having as its stationary distribution. For computational efficiency, the Markov	abstract	abstract
+L+
chain should be rapidly mixing. This can sometimes be achieved only by careful design of the	abstract	abstract
+L+
transition kernel of the chain, on the basis of a detailed preliminary exploratory analysis of . An	abstract	abstract
+L+
alternative approach might be to allow the transition kernel to adapt whenever new features of	abstract	abstract
+L+
are encountered during the MCMC run. However, if such adaptation occurs infinitely often, the	abstract	abstract
+L+
stationary distribution of the chain may be disturbed. We describe a framework, based on the	abstract	abstract
+L+
concept of Markov chain regeneration, which allows adaptation to occur infinitely often, but which	abstract	abstract
+L+
does not disturb the stationary distribution of the chain or the consistency of sample-path averages.	abstract	abstract

Abstract	abstract	abstract
+L+
Existing complexity measures from contemporary learning theory cannot be conveniently applied to specific learning problems (e.g., training sets). Moreover, they are typically non-generic,	abstract	abstract
+L+
i.e., they necessitate making assumptions about the way in which the learner will operate. The lack	abstract	abstract
+L+
of a satisfactory, generic complexity measure for learning problems poses difficulties for researchers	abstract	abstract
+L+
in various areas; the present paper puts forward an idea which may help to alleviate these. It	abstract	abstract
+L+
shows that supervised learning problems fall into two, generic, complexity classes only one of which	abstract	abstract
+L+
is associated with computational tractability. By determining which class a particular problem	abstract	abstract
+L+
belongs to, we can thus effectively evaluate its degree of generic difficulty.	abstract	abstract

Abstract:	abstract	abstract
+L+
Modern operating systems provide a rich set of interfaces for mapping, sharing, and protecting memory. Different	abstract	abstract
+L+
memory management unit (MMU) architectures provide different mechanisms for managing memory translations.	abstract	abstract
+L+
Since the same OS usually runs on different MMU architectures, a software hardware address translation (hat)	abstract	abstract
+L+
layer that abstracts the MMU architecture is normally implemented between MMU hardware and the virtual memory system of the OS. In this paper, we study the impact of the OS and the MMU on the structure and performance	abstract	abstract
+L+
of the hat layer. In particular, we concentrate on the role of the hat layer on the scalability of system performance	abstract	abstract
+L+
on symmetric multiprocessors with 2-12 CPUs. The results show that, unlike single-user applications, multi-user	abstract	abstract
+L+
applications require very careful multi-threading of the hat layer to achieve system performance that scales with	abstract	abstract
+L+
the number of CPUs. In addition, multi-threading the hat can result in better performance in lesser amounts of	abstract	abstract

physical memory.	abstract	abstract

Abstract	abstract	abstract
+L+
The relative slowdown of DRAMs with respect to	abstract	abstract
+L+
processor speeds and the widespread use of SMP	abstract	abstract
+L+
machines have bolstered the reliance on processor caches	abstract	abstract
+L+
to provide good performance. As a result, optimizing	abstract	abstract
+L+
machines and software for caches have recently received	abstract	abstract
+L+
more attention. In addition, with the popularity of	abstract	abstract
+L+
extensible computing, which includes the object oriented	abstract	abstract
+L+
programming style, shared libraries, and Java based	abstract	abstract
+L+
computing, creating effective compilers has become	abstract	abstract
+L+
more challenging, with an increased reliance on more	abstract	abstract
+L+
dynamic techniques, such as profiling and runtime code	abstract	abstract
+L+
generation. This paper proposes a dynamic optimization	abstract	abstract
+L+
method called cache windowing to reduce conflict misses	abstract	abstract
+L+
in L1 instruction caches. Using a combination of	abstract	abstract
+L+
hardware and software support, cache windowing	abstract	abstract
+L+
integrates a RollCache (a direct-mapped cache enhanced	abstract	abstract
+L+
to support dynamic cache configuration) and a software	abstract	abstract
+L+
implemented FIFO caching policy. Together, both allow	abstract	abstract
+L+
a program to reposition procedures, dynamically and	abstract	abstract
+L+
efficiently, to eliminate cache conflicts. Experiments	abstract	abstract
+L+
show that this type of caching scheme can achieve miss	abstract	abstract
+L+
rates competitive to a 2-way set associative cache for	abstract	abstract
+L+
various programs. Currently, a high software overhead	abstract	abstract
+L+
exists to support a software caching policy, though	abstract	abstract
+L+
different compiler optimizations, such as inlining, may	abstract	abstract
+L+
help to reduce this. Such a system provides a more robust	abstract	abstract
+L+
runtime architecture that, potentially, may adapt better to	abstract	abstract
+L+
a wider variety of environments.	abstract	abstract

Abstract	abstract	abstract
+L+
The analysis of nominal compound constructions has proven to be a recalcitrant problem	abstract	abstract
+L+
for linguistic semantics and poses serious challenges for natural language processing systems.	abstract	abstract
+L+
We argue for a compositional treatment of compound constructions which limits the need for	abstract	abstract
+L+
listing of compounds in the lexicon. We argue that the development of a practical model of	abstract	abstract
+L+
compound interpretation crucially depends on issues of lexicon design. The Generative Lexicon	abstract	abstract
+L+
(Pustejovsky 1995) provides us with a model of the lexicon which couples sufficiently expressive	abstract	abstract
+L+
lexical semantic representations with mechanisms which capture the relationship between those	abstract	abstract
+L+
representations and their syntactic expression. In our approach, the qualia structures of the	abstract	abstract
+L+
nouns in a compound provide relational structure enabling compositional interpretation of the	abstract	abstract
+L+
modification of the head noun by the modifying noun. This brings compound interpretation	abstract	abstract
+L+
under the same rubric as other forms of composition in natural language, including argument	abstract	abstract
+L+
selection, adjectival modification, and type coercion (Pustejovsky (1991,1995), Bouillon 1995).	abstract	abstract
+L+
We examine data from both English and Italian and develop analyses for both languages which use	abstract	abstract
+L+
phrase structure schemata to account for the connections between lexical semantic representation	abstract	abstract
+L+
and syntactic expression. In addition to applications in natural language understanding, machine	abstract	abstract
+L+
translation, and generation, the model of compound interpretation developed here can be applied	abstract	abstract
+L+
to multi-lingual information extraction tasks.	abstract	abstract

Mitchell defined and axiomatized a subtyping relationship (also known	abstract	abstract

+L+
(with "!" and "8"). This subtyping relationship is quite simple and does	abstract	abstract

proved this subtyping relationship to be undecidable. This paper supplies a new undecidability proof for this subtyping relationship. First, a	abstract	abstract
+L+
new syntax-directed axiomatization of the subtyping relationship is defined. Then, this axiomatization is used to prove a reduction from the	abstract	abstract
+L+
undecidable problem of semi-unification to subtyping. The undecidability of subtyping implies the undecidability of type checking for System F	abstract	abstract

extended with Mitchell's subtyping, also known as "F plus eta".	abstract	abstract

Abstract	abstract	abstract
+L+
Neural networks have been successfully applied in a wide range of supervised and unsupervised learning applications. Neural-network methods are not commonly used for data-mining	abstract	abstract
+L+
tasks, however, because they often produce incomprehensible models and require long training	abstract	abstract
+L+
times. In this article, we describe neural-network learning algorithms that are able to produce	abstract	abstract
+L+
comprehensible models, and that do not require excessive training times. Specifically, we discuss	abstract	abstract
+L+
two classes of approaches for data mining with neural networks. The first type of approach,	abstract	abstract
+L+
often called rule extraction, involves extracting symbolic models from trained neural networks.	abstract	abstract
+L+
The second approach is to directly learn simple, easy-to-understand networks. We argue that,	abstract	abstract
+L+
given the current state of the art, neural-network methods deserve a place in the tool boxes of	abstract	abstract
+L+
data-mining specialists.	abstract	abstract

Abstract	abstract	abstract
+L+
Given a set of training examples, determining the appropriate number of free parameters is a challenging problem. Constructive	abstract	abstract
+L+
learning algorithms attempt to solve this problem automatically by	abstract	abstract
+L+
adding hidden units, and therefore free parameters, during learning. We explore an alternative class of algorithms|called metamorphosis algorithms|in which the number of units is fixed, but	abstract	abstract
+L+
the number of free parameters gradually increases during learning.	abstract	abstract
+L+
The architecture we investigate is composed of RBF units on a lattice, which imposes flexible constraints on the parameters of the	abstract	abstract
+L+
network. Virtues of this approach include variable subset selection, robust parameter selection, multiresolution processing, and	abstract	abstract

interpolation of sparse training data.	abstract	abstract

Abstract	abstract	abstract
+L+
In this paper we study the issue of how to scale machine learning algorithms, that	abstract	abstract
+L+
typically are designed to deal with main-memory based datasets, to efficiently learn	abstract	abstract
+L+
models from large distributed databases. We have explored an approach called meta-learning that is related to the traditional approaches of data reduction commonly	abstract	abstract
+L+
employed in distributed database query processing systems. We explore the scalability	abstract	abstract
+L+
of learning arbiter and combiner trees from partitioned data. Arbiter and combiner	abstract	abstract
+L+
trees integrate classifiers trained in parallel from small disjoint subsets. Previous work	abstract	abstract
+L+
demonstrated the efficacy of these meta-learning architectures in terms of accuracy	abstract	abstract
+L+
of the computed meta-classifiers. Here we discuss the computational performance	abstract	abstract
+L+
of constructing arbiter and combiner trees in terms of speedup and scalability as a	abstract	abstract
+L+
function of database size and number of partitions. The performance of serial learning	abstract	abstract
+L+
algorithms is evaluated. We then analyze the performance of the algorithms used to	abstract	abstract
+L+
construct combiner and arbiter trees in parallel. Our empirical results validate these	abstract	abstract
+L+
analyses and indicate that the techniques can effectively scale up to large datasets with	abstract	abstract
+L+
millions of records using cheap commodity hardware.	abstract	abstract

A revolution is occurring in the scope and range	abstract	abstract

of information, communication and education services	abstract	abstract

that will be made available to schools, libraries, town-halls, clinics and, most importantly, residences. These	abstract	abstract

or cable companies. The old cable plant is being upgraded and used in totally new ways.	abstract	abstract
+L+
The topology and physical characteristics of the upstream channel present new challenges for efficient	abstract	abstract
+L+
channel access. We present a media access protocol	abstract	abstract
+L+
that efficiently transfers data on this channel. A primary goal in the design was to keep the portion of the	abstract	abstract
+L+
protocol resident in the station as simple as possible.	abstract	abstract
+L+
Thus we use centralized control located in the cable	abstract	abstract
+L+
head-end and minimize intelligence in the station. We	abstract	abstract
+L+
refer to this protocol as Centralized Priority Reservation or CPR. A station wishing to transmit sends a request to the head-end using a contention channel. The	abstract	abstract
+L+
head-end acknowledges the request and then schedules	abstract	abstract
+L+
the request, informing the station by means of a grant	abstract	abstract
+L+
message when to transmit.	abstract	abstract
+L+
The protocol performs well under heavy load. Performance is affected little by the number of stations,	abstract	abstract

Abstract	abstract	abstract

When a moldable job is submitted to a space-sharing	abstract	abstract

parallel computer, it must choose whether to begin execution on a small, available cluster or wait in queue for	abstract	abstract

more processors to become available. To make this decision, it must predict how long it will have to wait for	abstract	abstract

the larger cluster. We propose statistical techniques for	abstract	abstract

predicting these queue times, and develop an allocation	abstract	abstract

strategy that uses these predictions. We present a workload model based on observed workloads at the San Diego	abstract	abstract

and use this model to drive simulations of various allocation strategies. We find that prediction-based allocation	abstract	abstract

Abstract	abstract	abstract
+L+
A key question in conditional planning is: how many,	abstract	abstract
+L+
and which of the possible execution failures should be	abstract	abstract
+L+
planned for? One cannot, in general, plan for all the	abstract	abstract
+L+
possible failures because the search space is too large.	abstract	abstract
+L+
One cannot ignore all the possible failures, or one will	abstract	abstract
+L+
fail to produce sufficiently flexible plans. In this paper,	abstract	abstract
+L+
we describe an approach to conditional planning that	abstract	abstract
+L+
attempts to identify the contingencies that contribute	abstract	abstract
+L+
the most to a plan's overall utility. Plan generation	abstract	abstract
+L+
proceeds by handling the most important contingencies first, extending the plan to include actions that	abstract	abstract
+L+
will be taken in case the contingency fails. We discuss	abstract	abstract
+L+
the representational issues that must be addressed in	abstract	abstract
+L+
order to implement such an algorithm, and present an	abstract	abstract

example which illustrates our approach.	abstract	abstract

Models of physical systems can differ according to	abstract	abstract
+L+
computational cost, accuracy and precision, among	abstract	abstract
+L+
other things. Depending on the problem solving	abstract	abstract
+L+
task at hand, different models will be appropriate. Several investigators have recently developed	abstract	abstract
+L+
methods of automatically selecting among multiple models of physical systems. Our research is	abstract	abstract
+L+
novel in that we are developing model selection	abstract	abstract
+L+
techniques specifically suited to computer-aided de	abstract	abstract
+L+
sign. Our approach is based on the idea that artifact performance models for computer-aided design	abstract	abstract
+L+
should be chosen in light of the design decisions	abstract	abstract
+L+
they are required to support. We have developed	abstract	abstract
+L+
a technique called "Gradient Magnitude Model Selection" (GMMS), which embodies this principle.	abstract	abstract
+L+
GMMS operates in the context of a hillclimbing	abstract	abstract
+L+
search process. It selects the simplest model that	abstract	abstract
+L+
meets the needs of the hillclimbing algorithm in	abstract	abstract
+L+
which it operates. We are using the domain of sailing yacht design as a testbed for this research. We	abstract	abstract
+L+
have implemented GMMS and used it in hillclimb-ing search to decide between a computationally expensive potential-flow program and an algebraic	abstract	abstract
+L+
approximation to analyze the performance of sailing yachts. Experimental tests show that GMMS	abstract	abstract
+L+
makes the design process faster than it would be if	abstract	abstract
+L+
the most expensive model were used for all design	abstract	abstract

evaluations. GMMS achieves this performance improvement with little or no sacrifice in the quality	abstract	abstract

of the resulting design.	abstract	abstract

Abstract	abstract	abstract
+L+
To navigate effectively, an autonomous agent must be	abstract	abstract
+L+
able to quickly and accurately determine its current	abstract	abstract
+L+
location. Given an initial estimate of its position (perhaps based on dead-reckoning) and an image taken of	abstract	abstract
+L+
a known environment, our agent first attempts to locate a set of landmarks (real-world objects at known	abstract	abstract
+L+
locations), then uses their angular separation to obtain an improved estimate of its current position. Unfortunately, some landmarks may not be visible, or	abstract	abstract
+L+
worse, may be confused with other landmarks, resulting in both time wasted in searching for invisible landmarks, and in further errors in the agent's estimate of	abstract	abstract
+L+
its position. To address these problems, we propose a	abstract	abstract
+L+
method that uses previous experiences to learn a selection function that, given the set of landmarks that	abstract	abstract
+L+
might be visible, returns the subset which can reliably	abstract	abstract
+L+
be found correctly, and so provide an accurate registration of the agent's position. We use statistical techniques to prove that the learned selection function is,	abstract	abstract
+L+
with high probability, effectively at a local optimal in	abstract	abstract
+L+
the space of such functions. This report also presents	abstract	abstract
+L+
empirical evidence, using real-world data, that demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.	abstract	abstract

Quantum computing has witnessed a surge of activity recently owing	abstract	abstract

to some very exciting discoveries on both the theoretical and practical	abstract	abstract
+L+
fronts. In this overview, we sketch an account of the developments in	abstract	abstract
+L+
this scientifically intriguing field, starting in the early 80's when the first	abstract	abstract
+L+
questions about the computability of quantum processes were raised,	abstract	abstract
+L+
and which led to the formal definitions of a Quantum Computer and a	abstract	abstract
+L+
Quantum Complexity Theory. Peter Shor's recent remarkable discovery of quantum algorithms to solve the problems of integer factoring	abstract	abstract
+L+
and discrete log computing, which are believed to be extremely hard to	abstract	abstract
+L+
solve efficiently on classical computers, is a compelling demonstration	abstract	abstract
+L+
of the suspected superiority of quantum computing over the classical	abstract	abstract
+L+
model that is in use today. We discuss one of his algorithms and the	abstract	abstract
+L+
implications it has for classical cryptography. We discuss some of the	abstract	abstract
+L+
latest work in this field which has brought us yet closer to achieving a	abstract	abstract
+L+
physical realization of a quantum computer. Whenever it happens, if it	abstract	abstract

happens, it would be yet another revolution in the field of computing,	abstract	abstract

Abstract	abstract	abstract

We present an integrated framework for developing real-time systems in which lock-free algorithms are employed to	abstract	abstract

implement shared objects. There are two key objectives of	abstract	abstract
+L+
our work. The first is to enable functionality for object sharing in lock-free real-time systems that is comparable to that	abstract	abstract
+L+
in lock-based systems. Our main contribution toward this	abstract	abstract
+L+
objective is an efficient approach for implementing multi-object lock-free operations and transactions. A second key	abstract	abstract
+L+
objective of our work is to improve upon previously proposed	abstract	abstract
+L+
scheduling conditions for tasks that share lock-free objects.	abstract	abstract
+L+
When developing such conditions, the key issue is to bound	abstract	abstract
+L+
the cost of operation interferences. We present a general	abstract	abstract
+L+
approach for doing this, based on linear programming.	abstract	abstract

Abstract	abstract	abstract
+L+
Several cache-coherent shared-memory multiprocessors have been	abstract	abstract
+L+
developed that are scalable and offer a very tight coupling between	abstract	abstract
+L+
the processing resources. They are therefore quite attractive for	abstract	abstract
+L+
use as compute servers for multiprogramming and parallel application workloads. Process scheduling and memory management,	abstract	abstract
+L+
however, remain challenging due to the distributed main memory found on such machines. This paper examines the effects of	abstract	abstract
+L+
OS scheduling and page migration policies on the performance	abstract	abstract
+L+
of such compute servers. Our experiments are done on the Stan-ford DASH, a distributed-memory cache-coherent multiprocessor.	abstract	abstract
+L+
We show that for our multiprogramming workloads consisting of	abstract	abstract
+L+
sequential jobs, the traditional Unix scheduling policy does very	abstract	abstract
+L+
poorly. In contrast, a policy incorporating cluster and cache affinity along with a simple page-migration algorithm offers up to twofold performance improvement. For our workloads consisting of	abstract	abstract
+L+
multiple parallel applications, we compare space-sharing policies	abstract	abstract
+L+
that divide the processors among the applications to time-slicing	abstract	abstract
+L+
policies such as standard Unix or gang scheduling. We show	abstract	abstract
+L+
that space-sharing policies can achieve better processor utilization	abstract	abstract
+L+
due to the operating point effect, but time-slicing policies benefit	abstract	abstract
+L+
strongly from user-level data distribution. Our initial experience	abstract	abstract
+L+
with automatic page migration suggests that policies based only	abstract	abstract
+L+
on TLB miss information can be quite effective, and useful for	abstract	abstract
+L+
addressing the data distribution problems of space-sharing sched-ulers.	abstract	abstract

Abstract	abstract	abstract
+L+
An exhaustive dataflow-analysis algorithm associates with each point in a program a set of dataflow facts	abstract	abstract
+L+
that are guaranteed to hold whenever that point is reached during program execution. By contrast, a	abstract	abstract
+L+
demand dataflow-analysis algorithm determines whether a single given dataflow fact holds at a single given	abstract	abstract
+L+
point.	abstract	abstract
+L+
This paper presents a new demand algorithm for interprocedural dataflow analysis. The algorithm has	abstract	abstract
+L+
four important properties:	abstract	abstract
+L+
g It provides precise (meet-over-all-interprocedurally-valid-paths) solutions to a large class of problems.	abstract	abstract
+L+
g It has a polynomial worst-case cost for both a single demand and a sequence of all possible demands.	abstract	abstract
+L+
g The worst-case total cost of the sequence of all possible demands is no worse than the worst-case cost	abstract	abstract
+L+
of a single run of the current best exhaustive algorithm.	abstract	abstract
+L+
g Experimental results show that in many situations (e.g., when only a small number of demands are	abstract	abstract
+L+
made, or when most demands are answered yes) the demand algorithm is superior to the current best	abstract	abstract
+L+
exhaustive algorithm.	abstract	abstract

Abstract	abstract	abstract
+L+
Conventional implementations of communication middle-ware (such as CORBA and traditional RPC toolkits) incur	abstract	abstract
+L+
considerable overhead when used for performance-sensitive	abstract	abstract
+L+
applications over high-speed networks. As gigabit networks	abstract	abstract
+L+
become pervasive, inefficient middleware will force programmers to use lower-level mechanisms to achieve the necessary	abstract	abstract
+L+
transfer rates. This is a serious problem for mission/life-critical applications (such as satellite surveillance and medical imaging).	abstract	abstract
+L+
This paper compares the performance of several widely	abstract	abstract
+L+
used communication middleware mechanisms on a high-speed ATM network. The middleware ranged from lower-level mechanisms (such as socket-based C interfaces and	abstract	abstract
+L+
C++ wrappers for sockets) to higher-level mechanisms (such	abstract	abstract
+L+
as RPC, hand-optimized RPC and two implementations of	abstract	abstract
+L+
CORBA - Orbix 2.0.1 and ORBeline 2.0). These measurements reveal that the lower-level C and C++ implementations outperform the CORBA implementations significantly	abstract	abstract
+L+
(the best CORBA throughput for remote transfer was roughly	abstract	abstract
+L+
75 to 80 percent of the best C/C++ throughput for sending scalar data types and only around 33 percent for sending structs containing binary fields), and the hand-optimized	abstract	abstract
+L+
RPC code performs slightly better than the CORBA implementations. Our goal in precisely pinpointing the sources of	abstract	abstract
+L+
overhead for communication middleware is to develop scalable and flexible CORBA implementations that can deliver	abstract	abstract
+L+
gigabit data rates to applications.	abstract	abstract

Abstract	abstract	abstract
+L+
Optimistic replication is often viewed as essential for	abstract	abstract
+L+
large scale systems and for supporting mobile computing. In optimistic replication, updates can be made concurrently to different file replicas, resulting in multiple	abstract	abstract
+L+
versions of the file. To recover from these conflicting	abstract	abstract
+L+
updates, after-the fact conflict resolution actions are	abstract	abstract
+L+
required to recombine multiple versions into one. This	abstract	abstract
+L+
paper defines these concepts and discusses approaches	abstract	abstract
+L+
to measure them in optimistically replicated systems.	abstract	abstract
+L+
Measurement of the number of conflicting updates	abstract	abstract
+L+
and conflict resolution is important to judge the practicality of optimistic replication. An environment	abstract	abstract
+L+
where conflicting updates are frequent will not be attractive since users cannot assume they have up-to-date	abstract	abstract
+L+
data. Although many conflicts can be automatically	abstract	abstract
+L+
resolved, some conflicts require user intervention; such	abstract	abstract
+L+
conflicts cannot be too common. This paper shows an	abstract	abstract
+L+
approach to measure the number of conflicting updates.	abstract	abstract
+L+
From this measurement we derive the actual amount of	abstract	abstract
+L+
work done by the user or system to resolve conflicts	abstract	abstract
+L+
and the minimum amount of work required to resolve	abstract	abstract
+L+
conflicts.	abstract	abstract

What's Decidable about Hybrid Automata?	title	title
+L+
Thomas A. Henzinger 2 Peter W. Kopke 2 Anuj Puri 3 Pravin Varaiya 3	author	author
+L+
Abstract. Hybrid automata model systems with both	abstract	abstract
+L+
digital and analog components, such as embedded control programs. Many verification tasks for such programs	abstract	abstract
+L+
can be expressed as reachability problems for hybrid automata. By improving on previous decidability and undecidability results, we identify the precise boundary between decidability and undecidability of the reachability	abstract	abstract
+L+
problem for hybrid automata.	abstract	abstract
+L+
On the positive side, we give an (optimal) PSPACE	abstract	abstract
+L+
reachability algorithm for the case of initialized rectangular automata, where all analog variables follow trajectories within piecewise-linear envelopes and are reinitialized	abstract	abstract
+L+
whenever the envelope changes. Our algorithm is based	abstract	abstract
+L+
on a translation of an initialized rectangular automaton	abstract	abstract
+L+
into a timed automaton that defines the same timed language. The translation has practical significance for verification, because it guarantees the termination of symbolic	abstract	abstract
+L+
procedures for the reachability analysis of initialized rectangular automata.	abstract	abstract
+L+
On the negative side, we show that several slight generalizations of initialized rectangular automata lead to an	abstract	abstract
+L+
undecidable reachability problem. In particular, we prove	abstract	abstract
+L+
that the reachability problem is undecidable for timed automata with a single stopwatch.	abstract	abstract

Recovery from failures and erroneous executions is a crucial but complicated issue for concurrently accessed data systems. Increasingly sophisticated techniques are being developed to improve performance	abstract	abstract
+L+
and functionality of recovery protocols. To better understand and analyze recovery schemes, we reexamine the concept of spheres of control [Dav78], using it as a unifying framework for specifying diverse	abstract	abstract
+L+
recovery models simply and precisely. We constrain sphere-of-control formulations appropriately to capture transaction-oriented recovery in both centralized and distributed environments and with different	abstract	abstract
+L+
types of schedules, as well as semantics-based recovery and compensation. In addition, we discuss how	abstract	abstract
+L+
the operational semantics methodology of evolving algebras [Gur95] can model spheres of control formally	abstract	abstract
+L+
and refine them to lower levels of abstraction.	abstract	abstract

Mixed-initiative systems present the challenge of finding an effective level of interaction between humans	abstract	abstract

Improving Programming-by-Demonstration With Better Semantic Expression	title	title
+L+
Thesis Proposal	degree	degree
+L+
Richard McDaniel	author	author
+L+
November 14, 1995	date	date
+L+
Abstract	abstract	abstract
+L+
The domain of applications that can be created with programming-by-demonstration	abstract	abstract
+L+
(PBD) can be extended by improving the developers ability to communicate with the system. The	abstract	abstract
+L+
techniques provided in this thesis will allow nonprogrammers to create a new variety of complete,	abstract	abstract
+L+
interactive applications including many board games and educational software using PBD.	abstract	abstract
+L+
A PBD software tool uses inferencing to induce programs by watching the developer demonstrate examples that show how the application should behave. Current systems reduce their scope	abstract	abstract
+L+
or resort to having the developer program because they do not provide sufficient ways to express	abstract	abstract
+L+
behaviors and the factors that affect them. Therefore, the goal of this thesis is to develop understandable forms of annotated expression and manipulation that help a system infer a broader range	abstract	abstract
+L+
of behavior. To test these ideas, this proposal introduces a new system called Gamut that will	abstract	abstract
+L+
present the techniques in a unified software tool.	abstract	abstract
+L+
The first technique replaces the macro recorder method for demonstrating behavior used	abstract	abstract
+L+
in other PBD systems with a technique called nudges. The developer demonstrates by correcting	abstract	abstract
+L+
the system at important points during program execution and also using two nudge commands to	abstract	abstract
+L+
communicate important situations. First, the Do Something! nudge causes the system to reconsider	abstract	abstract
+L+
past learned behavior and try to generalize its knowledge to fit the current situation. Using the	abstract	abstract
+L+
Stop That! nudge will point out improper behavior and generate negative examples.	abstract	abstract
+L+
Second, Gamut will use a new deck-of-playing-cards metaphor to express concepts such	abstract	abstract
+L+
as randomness, sequencing, and data storage. By constructing an appropriate deck, shufing, sorting, and playing cards at key moments, developers can incorporate many effects not available without programming in other systems.	abstract	abstract

Third, Gamut will improve communication about behaviors by making them more manipulable than in previous systems. Behaviors will be represented as small icons near the objects they	abstract	abstract
+L+
affect. Using the familiar cut, copy, and paste commands, the developer can transfer behavior	abstract	abstract
+L+
between objects. Determining how to make a behavior operate in the new context will be inferred	abstract	abstract
+L+
automatically. An objects state from the recent past will be represented as temporal ghosts in	abstract	abstract
+L+
which objects become dimmed, translucent images. Many sorts of behavior refer to prior states	abstract	abstract
+L+
such as a previous position or an old property value. The ghost objects will allow the developer to	abstract	abstract
+L+
make explicit connections.	abstract	abstract
+L+
Finally, to reduce the number of options the system must explore, the developer will be	abstract	abstract
+L+
able to give hints by highlighting important objects and properties. A new inferencing algorithm	abstract	abstract
+L+
will be created that will take advantage of the hints.	abstract	abstract
+L+
By combining these techniques, Gamut will provide a rich medium for expressing developer intentions, fostering greater communication between the PBD system and the developer and	abstract	abstract
+L+
enabling the developer to create highly interactive software with minimal programming expertise.	abstract	abstract

Abstract. A knowledge-level analysis of complex tasks like diagnosis and design can give us a better understanding of these tasks in terms of the goals they	abstract	abstract
+L+
aim to achieve and the different ways to achieve these goals. In this paper we	abstract	abstract
+L+
present a knowledge-level analysis of redesign. Redesign is viewed as a family of	abstract	abstract
+L+
methods based on some common principles, and a number of dimensions along	abstract	abstract
+L+
which redesign problem solving methods can vary are distinguished. By examining the problem-solving behavior of a number of existing redesign systems and approaches, we came up with a collection of problem-solving methods for redesign	abstract	abstract
+L+
and developed a task-method structure for redesign.	abstract	abstract
+L+
In constructing a system for redesign a large number of knowledge-related choices	abstract	abstract
+L+
and decisions are made. In order to describe all relevant choices in redesign problem solving, we have to extend the current notion of possible relations between	abstract	abstract
+L+
tasks and methods in a PSM architecture. The realization of a task by a problem-solving method, and the decomposition of a problem-solving method into subtasks are the most common relations in a PSM architecture. However, we suggest	abstract	abstract
+L+
to extend these relations with the notions of task refinement and method refinement. These notions represent intermediate decisions in a task-method structure,	abstract	abstract
+L+
in which the competence of a task or method is refined without immediately paying attention to its operationalization in terms of subtasks. Explicit representation	abstract	abstract
+L+
of this kind of intermediate decisions helps to make and represent decisions in a	abstract	abstract
+L+
more piecemeal fashion.	abstract	abstract

Abstract	abstract	abstract
+L+
Recently Propp and Wilson [14] have proposed an algorithm, called	abstract	abstract
+L+
Coupling from the Past (CFTP), which allows not only an approximate but perfect (i.e. exact) simulation of the stationary distribution	abstract	abstract
+L+
of certain finite state space Markov chains. Perfect Sampling using	abstract	abstract
+L+
CFTP has been successfully extended to the context of point processes, amongst other authors, by Haggstrom et al. [5]. In [5] Gibbs	abstract	abstract
+L+
sampling is applied to a bivariate point process, the penetrable spheres	abstract	abstract
+L+
mixture model [19]. However, in general the running time of CFTP	abstract	abstract
+L+
in terms of number of transitions is not independent of the state sampled. Thus an impatient user who aborts long runs may introduce a	abstract	abstract
+L+
subtle bias, the user impatience bias. Fill [3] introduced an exact sampling algorithm for finite state space Markov chains which, in contrast	abstract	abstract
+L+
to CFTP, is unbiased for user impatience. Fill's algorithm is a form	abstract	abstract
+L+
of rejection sampling and similar to CFTP requires sufficient mono-tonicity properties of the transition kernel used. We show how Fill's	abstract	abstract
+L+
version of rejection sampling can be extended to an infinite state space	abstract	abstract
+L+
context to produce an exact sample of the penetrable spheres mixture	abstract	abstract
+L+
process and related models. Following [5] we use Gibbs sampling and	abstract	abstract
+L+
make use of the partial order of the mixture model state space. Thus	abstract	abstract
