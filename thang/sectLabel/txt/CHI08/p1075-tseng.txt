ABSTRACT
An important question for Human-Computer Interaction is 
to understand how and why visual search strategy is 
adapted to the demands imposed by the task of searching 
the results of a search engine. There is emerging evidence 
that a key part of the answer concerns the expected 
information gain of each of the set of available information 
gathering actions. We build on previous research to show 
that people are acutely sensitive to differences in the density 
and in the number of items returned by the search engine. 
These factors cause shifts in the efficiency of the available 
information gathering actions. We focus on an image 
browsing task, and show that, as a consequence of changes 
to the efficiency of available actions, people make small but 
significant changes to eye-movement strategy.

INTRODUCTION
An important question for Human-Computer Interaction 
(HCI) is how to design the presentation of search results to 
facilitate visual search behaviour [9,20,35]. Researchers 
have proposed many alternatives to the standard list of 
results. They include Space-filling thumbnails of text [7], 
Tabular interface [36], Faceted category interface [42], and 
Textually-enhanced thumbnails [41].

The number of proposals is, in part, a reflection of the scale 
of the design space. Identifying which of the potentially 
hundreds of interesting points in this space is best might be 
informed by a theory of how people choose to search 
through results, e.g. an ACT-R or EPIC theory of the 
cognitive, motor, and perceptual processing required to 
achieve the task [2,18,22,23]. Recent efforts to understand, 
what Payne, Howes and Reader [28] call interactive search 
tasks, have included [5,6,8,13,31]. However, it is 
sometimes difficult to ascertain which interface will be best 
when the details of the strategy that people will use given a 
particular task environment are unclear [10,14,17,19]. In 
this paper we are interested in the strategy choices that 
people make about visual search, i.e. how they choose to 
look at search results. Our focus is on the assumption that 
people attempt to maximise expected utility given the 
constraints of the human visual system [8,39] and that 
design changes which change the efficiency of information 
gathering actions will lead to changes in observed 
behaviour.
There is some evidence in the visual perception and 
cognition literature that visual search strategy is adapted to 
the demands imposed by particular task environments 
[4,26,40]. It appears that people seek to maximise the 
efficiency of visual search in the context of the particular 
display layout. For example, longer fixations enable more 
information to be gathered from fovea and peripheral 
vision, although longer fixations can only be effective if the 
information is available within the perceptual span [26]. 
Moreover, people need to manage the trade-off between the 
increased information gain of longer fixations and the effort 
and time cost of holding a fixation.
Some evidence that people adapt their strategy to the task 
can also be found in the HCI literature. For example, trade-
offs in the use of wide versus narrow spacing between icons 
[11], in more but smaller text versus fewer but bigger text 
in the same space [15] and in the use of Hyperbolic browser 
versus standard browser [30]. Even in a standard results 
layout, such as a simple list of links, there is evidence that 
search strategy is affected by the context in which the 
relevance of items is assessed [5,6,8,13]. The position of a 
target item in a list and relationship between the relevance 
of this target and distractor items affects search behaviour

[5,6,13]. These finding support the view that search and 
selection is guided by maximising the expected information 
gain [8]. Strikingly there is evidence that maximising 
expected gain can involve fixating on every other item in a 
list, rather than fixating on contiguous items [5,6], 
particularly in contexts where good results have already 
been encountered.
In a number of respects people appear to be sensitive to the 
expected information gain of information gathering actions. 
In the following section we review in more detail the 
literature on the trade-offs that contribute toward the 
efficiency of information gathering actions during visual 
search. We are interested in the broad class of interactive 
search tasks [28] but our particular focus is on the visual 
search strategies and decision-making processes that people 
use when looking through items returned by an image 
search engine such as Flickr or Google. Further, we are 
interested in everyday tasks with somewhat underspecified 
target criteria, e.g. look for attractive images of the city 
Florence. In what follows we consider the relevance of the 
visual search and HCI literature to understanding these 
kinds of task.
RELATED WORK
Visual Search in HCI
Researchers in HCI have suggested that the details of 
interface design affect visual search strategy (e.g., 
[11,15,30]). Everett and Byrne [11], for example, suggested 
a small difference of 1.6 degrees of visual angle between 
items can result in participants either fixating on an icon or 
not. Similarly, Halverson and Hornof [15] provided 
evidence that low density, task-meaningless large words 
could lead participants to use fewer and shorter fixations 
and so shorter overall search time than when given high 
density, small, task-meaningless, words. Similarly, Pirolli, 
Card, and Van Der Wege [30] found that participants used 
more but shorter fixations when using a Hyperbolic browser 
than when using a standard browser, especially in areas of 
the Hyperbolic browser in which small, low information 
scent items, were grouped closely together.
Visual Search in Experimental Psychology
In the visual search literature, there is compelling evidence 
that the density of items on the display has consequences 
for search strategy. Ojanpää, Näsänen and Kojo [26] found 
that decreased spacing in a vertical list of words (common 
Finnish verbs, nouns and adjectives) resulted in longer but 
fewer numerous fixations. Vlaskamp, Over and Hooge [40] 
found that the fixation duration, number of fixation and 
search time increased dramatically with decreasing item 
spacing, as the range of spacing smaller than 1.5° visual 
angle. On the other hand, their data showed that at wide 
spacing range between 1.5° to 7.1° fixation duration, 
number of fixations and search time increased slightly as 
the spacing increased. Bertera and Rayner [4] found that as 
the item spacing increased the number of fixations and 
fixation duration increased.
Although allowing a high degree of experimental control 
the tasks [4,26,40] lack ecological validity. For example, 
Vlaskamp, Over and Hooge [40] used abstract shapes (e.g., 
squares) in their search task, and, Bertera and Rayner [4] 
used an unstructured alphanumeric array. Ojanpää, Näsänen 
and Kojo [26]) used common-words, which reduced the 
task to a simple visual pattern match, rather than a match of 
information scent but it is known that search behaviour is 
contingent on label relevance [5,6]. The different materials 
may account for the different effects. Both tasks are far 
from the real HCI task in which the stimuli are more 
heterogeneous and complicated.
Strategy Change during Search
Visual search strategies are also known to change during 
the course of a search [27,33]. Over, Hooge, Vlaskamp and 
Erkelens [27] found that fixation duration increased and the 
amplitude of saccade decreased gradually as search 
progressed. They called this is a coarse-to-fine strategy. 
Rao, Zelinsky, Hayhoe and Ballard [33] used a coarse-to-
fine matching mechanism to model the skipping saccades 
because it could increase the probability of an early match. 
In contrast, Brumby and Howes [6] found a fine-to-coarse 
search strategy. People increased saccade amplitude once 
they had found, but not committed to, a highly relevant 
target suggesting that although it is known that strategy can 
change, the reasons for change are not always clear.
Also, it is known that people spend more time examining 
items that are presented nearer to the top of the returned 
search results [9,13], presumably, and in part, because 
search engines tend to rank order results. However, what is 
not clear is whether people change visual search strategy as 
they examine links further from the top of the results list. 
For example, they may be more likely to skip i.e. fixate 
alternate, non-adjacent, items once a potential hit has been 
found, as was observed in [6].
THEORY
We assume that people make strategic adaptations in order 
to improve the efficiency of visual search, that is that they 
rationally adapt the strategy, given cognitive, perceptual, 
and motor constraints, to maximise benefits while 
minimising costs [1,8,17,28,29]. More specifically, people 
adapt their eye movement strategy to maximise the 
expected gain of task-relevant information and minimise the 
neural resources devoted to memory [25] and cognitive and 
attentional load [3]. In this paper, we take an “active vision” 
approach [12] to understanding the complex interactive 
behaviours that people exhibit when searching for 
information. Understanding these behaviours requires 
bridging between theories of visual search, visual 
exploration, and decision-making.
Following Cox and Young [8] we assumed that people are 
sensitive to the prior probabilities that any particular item 
will be the target item. Cox and Young operationalised this 
assumption by assuming that prior probabilities were
1076
CHI 2008 Proceedings · Search	April 5-10, 2008 · Florence, Italy
normalized over the set of potential targets. More search 
items implies lower initial priors.
Following Ojanpää, Näsänen and Kojo [26] we assumed 
that the information that can be gathered given the 
perceptual span is (1) contingent on the item density, (2) 
contingent on the duration of fixation.
Combining the theories of Cox and Young [8] and Ojanpää, 
Näsänen and Kojo [26] we assume that the visual search 
strategy is rationally adapted to the information that can be 
gained from the perceptual span. On this basis we made 
two predictions:
(1) that packing items together more closely (high density) 
would allow more information to be harvested from the 
perceptual span given sufficient time. We predicate that 
people would therefore increase the duration spent looking 
at any one item, and reduce the number of items directly 
fixated. That is, they would take advantage of the fact that 
more information was available for each fixation.
(2) if there are more search items then the gaze durations 
and the rate of number of items directly fixated in a trial 
should decrease because the prior probability of any one 
item being the target item is decreased [8]. In other words, 
when there are more results returned we expect people to 
give each result less time, presumably reducing the quality 
of each evaluation in order to conduct more evaluations. 
The eye movement strategy should switch to a lower cost 
strategy, involving more item skipping [6].
EXPERIMENT
Method
This study investigates the consequences of expected 
information gain for the visual search strategy that people 
use given pages of thumbnails returned by a search engine. 
Participants were asked to imagine that they were choosing 
where to go on holiday, and that they were using the web to 
gather information about various places that they could visit. 
In particular, their goal was to use a particular image search 
engine site to find an image of a visually attractive 
destination.
Stimuli and Design
There were 180 unique sets of images. Each set included 
image thumbnails about a place, such as a resort, city or 
country. These image thumbnails were selected from the 
search results responding to keywords or search phrases 
input in an image search engine of Flickr, a photo sharing 
website. Moreover, each set at least contains 1,000 photo 
results matching the name of the place. For example, Flickr 
found 423,166 up-to-date results for photos matching 
Florence. We filtered out the tourists’ poor quality self- 
portrait, maps and pictures with special effect, such as High 
Dynamic Range (HDR) images which is not clear in the 
task thumbnail size. Finally, we selected 180 photo 
thumbnails for each set. So, totally, we had unique 32,400 
thumbnails (180 sets × 180 thumbnails). At the eye-to-

screen distance of 60 centimeters used in the experiment, 
the size of thumbnails (75 × 75 pixels) subtended a visual 
angle of 2.15°.
The experiment was a within-subjects design and had two 
independent variables. These were thumbnail density and 
number of pages (set size). Density had two levels with 
narrow or wide spacing between items displayed in the 
search task. Figure 1 shows a sample display from one high 
density trial. The edge-to-edge item spacings were 3 pixels 
(visual angle = 0.085°) in high density layout. Figure 2
1077

shows one low density trial. The edge-to-edge item 
spacings were 30 pixels (visual angle = 0.85°) in low 
density display. Unlike in Halverson and Hornof [15] and 
Pirolli, Card, and Van Der Wege [30] the size of thumbnails 
was held constant, so that density was manipulated by 
changing proximity only.
Number of pages had three levels: 1-page, 2-pages and 5- 
pages. Each page consisted of exactly 36 thumbnails (6 × 6 
square layout). In the 1-page condition, there were 36 
thumbnails in total and the first 36 of 180 thumbnails of 
sets were used. In 2-pages condition, 1st to 36th thumbnails 
were used in the first page; 37th to 72nd thumbnails were 
used in the second page and there were 72 thumbnails in 
total. In the 5-pages condition, all 180 thumbnails were 
used sequentially. There were page links below thumbnails 
in any page. It appeared all the time (see figure 1 and 2). 
Participants could click these links to switch between pages 
during a trial. So, when Participants searched in the first 
page, they also gained the information about how many 
pages in this task.
In total, there were 6 conditions (2 densities × 3 number of 
pages). Each condition had 30 trials. The total number of 
trials was 180. Each set of thumbnails could be arranged 
into one of six conditions. The presentations of each set of 
thumbnails were counterbalanced across subjects.
Apparatus
The experiment was performed with a Tobii 1750 eye 
tracker. The eyetracker is embodied in a 17” monitor. The 
eye tracker has a tracking rate or the frame rate of 50 Hz. 
The temporal resolution of 20 ms is sufficient for 
monitoring long fixation and eye movements in our task. 
Although low temporal resolution could cause noise in 
signal sampling, noise was reduced by averaging several 
gazes per page and by testing 30 trials per condition. The 
screen resolutions were set at 1024×768 pixels.
Participants
Participants were twenty four students from University of 
Manchester who received 5-10 pounds depending on their 
time for their volunteer. All participants were between 18 
and 28 years old and have normal vision or corrected-to-
normal vision.
Procedure
Participants were presented with instructions and then a 
practice block allowed them to become familiar with the 
task. After the practice block, the eye tracker system was 
calibrated. And then participants completed all 180 trials.
The whole Experiment took between 40 minutes and 70 
minutes depending on different participants. The variation 
in time was because we didn’t give our participants any 
time limitation. Some participants were faster than others.
The participant looked at a place label then clicked on the 
search button to make thumbnail search results appear. The 
participant was instructed to move the cursor to a thumbnail
of a visually attractive destination and click on it to finish a 
trial. The trial process and interface are shown in Figure 1.
Results
Normally, eye movement studies analysed participants’ 
search time, number of fixations and fixation duration. 
When we observed the participants’ search behaviour, we 
also found the gaze transitions were not always from one 
item to the next adjacent item; instead, participants skipped 
one or more items during their saccade. We calculated how 
many gaze transitions were not between spatially adjacent 
thumbnails. Therefore, in this study, we were interested in 
visual search performance, particularly in how (1) search 
time and (2) number of item gazes (all contiguous fixations 
on an item were combined to be a single gaze), (3) gaze 
duration (the sum of all fixation durations on a thumbnail 
prior to moving to another thumbnail), and (4) the 
proportion of skipping gaze transitions (the total number of 
gaze transitions divided by the number of skipping gaze 
transitions), are affected by the thumbnails density and 
number of pages. The data in the revisited page were not 
included. These four measures might reveal the adaptation 
of search strategy while participants interact with different 
item densities and number of items.
We predicted that when the thumbnails were displayed 
close together, participants would spend longer in a gaze, 
and be more likely to skip thumbnails during search in the 
display, than when thumbnails were displayed further apart. 
In addition, page links below the thumbnails indicated that 
the number of pages and total items in the task. We 
predicted that when there are more pages and thumbnails, 
people would adopt a different strategy which would be 
revealed by these four measures.
Overall Performance
Figure 3 illustrates the overall performance. There were 
significant main density effect on total search time (F(1,23) 
= 23.43, p < 0.001), number of gazes (F(1,23) = 15.87, 
p=0.001), gaze duration (F(1,23) = 17.34, p < 0.001), and 
proportion of skipping gaze transitions (F(1,23) = 35.04, 
p<0.001). The results showed that participant spent less 
time (M = 12,709 ms vs 14,044 ms, figure 3a), fewer gazes 
(M = 8.16 vs 9.28, figure 3b), longer gaze (M = 407 ms vs 
387 ms, figure 3c) and skipped more often (M = 72.4% vs 
67.7%, figure 3d) in high versus low density.
There were significant main number of pages effects on 
total search time (F(2,46) = 136.54, p < 0.001), number of 
gazes (F(2,46) = 73.18, p < 0.001), gaze duration (F(2,46) = 
10.16, p < 0.001), and proportion of skipping gaze 
transitions (F(2,46) = 8.37, p=0.001). A Bonferroni test 
revealed that every pairwise comparison was significantly 
different (p < 0.05). According to the pairwise comparison, 
participants spent significantly less time (1-page: M = 7,514 
ms, 2-pages: M = 11,482 ms and 5-pages: M = 21,132 ms), 
gazed less (1-page: M = 10.96, 2-pages: M = 15.8 and 5- 
pages: M = 28.02), and skipped less often (1-page: M = 
66.5%, 2-pages: M = 70.7% and 5-pages: M = 72.9%), in

the fewer page condition. Also, pairwise comparison 
showed that they spent longer gaze duration in the 1-page 
condition (M = 401 ms) than 5-page condition (M = 369 
ms), although 2-pages is not significant different to 1-page 
and 5-pages condition. There were no significant 
interactions on total search time, number of gazes and gaze 
duration, except proportion of skipping gaze transitions, 
F(2,46) = 3.73, p < 0.05.
Moreover, following Reiman, Young and Howes [34], we 
analysed the revisiting. Figure 4a shows the number of 
items that were visited at least once and revisited (i.e. 
visited at least twice) for each experimental condition. 
Participant revisited around 22% to 27% of visited items for 
each condition. Density and number of pages had similar 
effects on the number of visited and the number of revisited 
items. Participants visited and revisited more items in low 
density (all p’s < 0.01) and when there were more pages (a 
Bonferroni test for analysing three page levels showed 
every pair was significantly different, p < 0.001). In

(bars with solid pattern) and items visited at least twice
(bars with line pattern) and (b) mean duration of an item

addition, figure 4b shows that our participants spent more 
time on an item when they revisited it than when they 
visited it the fist time, F(1,20) = 99.788, P < 0.001.
Performance in the First Page
We analysed data in more detail. In this section we contrast 
performance in the first page of each condition. (Not all 
conditions had subsequent pages so the first page provides 
the critical test. In addition, it is the first page behaviour 
that should be affected by information about the number of 
pages, rather than by the quality of the additional items.) 
We analysed our four measures (search time, number of 
gazes, gaze duration and skipping rate) taken from the first 
page of search results. We conducted a 2 × 3 (density × 
number of pages) repeated-measure ANOVA for each 
measure separately.
Duration on a page was defined as the total time from the 
display onset to the time leaving the first page by click a 
page number link, or from the onset to the start of 
participants’ last fixation on the clicked target.
As expected, there was a main effect of density on mean 
search time in the first page, F(1,23) = 28.27, p < 0.001. 
The search performance in the fist page was quicker in high 
density (M = 6082.24 ms) than low density (M = 6742.9 
ms). There was also a main effect of number of pages on 
search time of the first page, F(2,46) = 15.82,p < 0.001.

Figure 5c illustrates mean first page gaze duration. 
Participants’ mean gaze duration in the first page was 
longer in the high density (M = 407 ms) than low density 
layout (M = 387.259 ms), F(1,23) = 22.414, p < 0.001. The 
main effect of number of pages was not significant. There 
was no interaction between density and number of pages.
Figure 5d shows the data of mean proportion of first page 
skipping gaze transitions. The density had significant effect, 
F (1, 23) = 46.72, p < 0.001. It was found that that 
participants were more likely to skip thumbnails in the high 
density (M = 72%) than in the low density layout (M = 
67.2%). The main effect of number of pages was also 
significant, F (2, 46) = 15.00, p < 0.001. Every pairwise 
comparison of number of pages condition was significantly 
different (p < 0.01). It showed that our participants skipped 
more often in 5-pages condition (M = 66.5%), than they did 
in 2-pages condition (M = 70.3%), which in turn was more 
often than in the 1-page condition (M = 71.8%). There was 
no interaction between density and number of pages.

Every pair comparison of number of pages condition with 
Bonferroni method was significantly different (p < 0.01). It 
was found that time spent in the first page was more in the 
fewer page condition (1-page: M = 7514.54 ms, 2-pages: M 
= 6117.07 ms and 5-pages: M = 5606.10 ms). The 
interaction between density and number of pages was not 
significant. Results are summarized in Figure 5a.
Figure 5b shows the data of mean number of gazes in the 
first page. Number of gazes was approximate one fewer in 
the high density (M = 8.16) than low density (M = 9.29), 
F(1,23) = 24.65, p < 0.001. There was also a main effect of 
number of pages, F(2,46) = 24.9, p < 0.001. Every pair 
comparison of number of pages condition with Bonferroni 
method was significantly different (p < 0.001). It showed 
that participants spent greater number of gazes in fewer 
page conditions (1-page: M = 10.96, 2-pages: M = 8.07 and 
5-pages condition: M = 7.11). In addition, the interaction of 
density and number of pages was also significant, F(2,46) = 
4.48, p = 0.017. The fewest number of gazes were made in 
the first page of the high density display when there were 5- 
pages of items.

Performance per Page
Figure 6 summarises the mean performance of our eighteen 
participants’ eye movement behaviour in the high density 
condition. (All results of the low density condition has the 
same trend as in the high density condition) Figure 6a 
shows mean search duration per page, figure 6b shows 
mean number of gazes per page, figure 6c shows mean gaze 
duration per page and figure 6d shows the proportion of 
skipping gaze transitions in number of pages condition. 
Each bar within a page condition shows the performance on 
each page of that condition. For example, the only bar in the 
1-page condition shows performance in the 1-page 
condition, the two bars in 2-pages condition show each 
performance in page 1 and 2 and the five bars in 5-page 
condition show each performance from page 1 to page 5, 
from left to right respectively.
When we examined whether participants adopted different 
strategies in different pages in a search course, the values of 
four measures of search performance were taken from each 
page.
Because there were four participants who didn’t have data 
in all five pages in the 5-page condition, we took out these 
four participants. Then, we arbitrarily selected and removed 
another two participants from the analysis to keep the 
counterbalanced design. Therefore, in this section, the 
results were from analysing eighteen participants’ data. The 
following analyses were conducted in 2-pages and 5-pages 
condition separately.
In the 2-pages condition, every measure of four search 
performance of participants was not significantly different 
in page 1 and page2. it indicated that the search strategy did
not vary in the first and second page, when participants 
search in a 2-pages display (see Figure 6a, b, c, d, 2-pages 
condition).
In 5-pages condition, the results of a 5×2 repeated-measure 
ANOVA (page number: page 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 × density: 
high and low) showed there were main effect of page 
number and density on every measure of search 
performance our participants’ performance (see Figure 6 a, 
b, c, d, 5-pages condition). The results of search 
performance per page in the 5-pages condition are 
summarized in Table 1. In general, search performance was 
in page number 1 is different to other pages.
pairwise comparisons of page number with Bonferroni 
method in search duration, number of gazes, and proportion 
of skipping gaze transitions showed that the measures in 
page 1 were different from those in page 2 to page 5 (pair 
between page 1 and any other page was significant, p<0.01 
and pair between page 2 to page 5 were not significant 
different). There was a significant difference between page 
1 and page 3 in gaze duration. Although any other pair does 
not reach significant, there was a trend for people to take 
longer gaze on page 1 than on pages 2, 3, 4, or 5. This 
indicated that participants search in the first page more 
carefully than other pages.
DISCUSSION
The results support the claim that visual search strategy is 
guided by expected information gain when people search 
results returned by an image search engine:

items were available within the perceptual span (higher 
density), longer item visits were used, and when fewer 
items were available (lower density), shorter item visits 
were used. Longer visits were only used when they were 
efficient, i.e. when expected information gain was high.
2. Longer visits to items were combined with skipping. 
Participants in the high density conditions skipped items 
more often, visited fewer items, and spent less time 
searching overall.	In other words, when the potential
information gain for longer visits was high, people made 
more use of longer visits and reduced the number of items 
that they directly fixated. They made more use of the 
perceptual span when it was rational given the constraints 
of the visual system to do so, and gained an overall 
reduction in the required search time.
3. Participants were observed to reduce the number of items 
that they visited, i.e. they skipped, when there was a larger 
number of items (Figure 5d) but without increasing the 
duration spent attending to each item (Figure 5c). These 
findings suggest that skipping was sensitive to the prior 
probability that any one item would be attractive enough to 
be selected but that gaze duration was not.
4. Participants spent more time on an item, when they 
revisited it than when they visited it for the first time. this 
findings indicates that people may use an iterative 
deepening of attention [34]. This strategy may help 
participants to parse large amounts of information quickly 
using lower tolerance to rule out poor quality items and 
then focus effort on a smaller set. The difference between 
[34] and our study is that our participants didn’t sample all 
items before they started to revisit, especially in conditions 
with more pages (Figure 4b). This finding suggests that the 
set size of potential items may be constrained by the 
capacity limitation in memory. We also observed 
participants select an item at the first time visit before 
sampling all items. This indicated that people also picked 
an item immediately when the value of the item currently 
visited is beyond their satisficing criteria [38]. Adopting the 
coarse-to-fine strategy [27,33] and employing satisficing 
[38] could save lots of visual processing cost for sampling 
out poor items quickly and gain an item with satisficing 
value or gain a revisited item with acceptable value.
In sum, the results support the view that people adjusted 
their visual search strategy to their expectations of 
information gain, and that these expectations were 
contingent on (a) the density of items, and (b) the prior 
likelihood that an item is the one that they will want to 
select. In the remainder of the Discussion we first offer 
further explanations for the details of the findings, we then 
discuss some design implications.
Further Explanations
Why, for some designs, is it more efficient to use fewer 
longer gazes than more, shorter, ones? Essentially, because 
planning and executing gaze transitions, saccades, is
expensive. Planning and executing a new gaze so as to 
bring a foveal fixation to a new place requires effort, both 
mental and physical effort. Neurophysiological evidence 
indicates that making a saccade involves high cost neural 
processes to keep the visual scene stable (see [37] review). 
Therefore, to prolong an old gaze to gain information about 
an adjacent item can cost less than to plan and execute a 
new gaze. For example, in our experiment a new item visit 
took an extra 400 ms, but a longer gaze took only about 20 
ms more. Although each longer gaze takes more time, fewer 
gazes are required, reducing the overall visual search time.
Why was it not possible for participants to increase 
perceptual span to cover adjacent items in lower density 
displays? Findings reported by Hooge, Vlaskamp and Over 
[16] suggest that information can be gathered from a wider 
area of a display as gaze durations increase, i.e. it is 
possible that perceptual span is itself contingent on duration 
of fixation. However, there are clearly limits [4], and it 
appears as though the reduction in the rate that information 
can be acquired caused by the lower densities in our 
experiment pushed participants beyond this limit.
Will the findings generalise to other types of search result 
items? There is some evidence that the finding would 
generalise to word items. For example, Pollatsek, Perea 
and Binder [32] found that fixation duration is longer when 
a word with more neighbours than few neighbours. Longer 
fixation duration in a more dense display suggests that more 
information within the perceptual span is required to be 
processed serially. In contrast, Motter and Belky [24] 
showed that fixation duration didn’t change as the number 
of items within a 4° constant area and assumed that this 
result is because items surrounding a fixation are processed 
in parallel (number of items surrounded the fixation will not 
affect the fixation duration). These contrary results could be 
because of the relative complexities of stimuli in these two 
tasks are so different. Simple items, e.g. symbols, adjacent 
to a fixation can be processed in parallel, but complex items 
such photographic thumbnails in our task have to be 
processed in series and result in longer durations.
Why do the findings differ from previous research? The 
importance of ecological validity. The observed density 
effect on gaze duration and number of gazes are consistent 
with some previous studies [26], but contrary to others 
[4,15]. Unlike most of the previous studies, our target was 
not defined by only one or two visual features (color, shape, 
and orientation et al.) or non-words (non-words without 
semantic meaning can be searched by their shape or the 
order of characters), but was, instead, informed by the 
semantic description of a place. In contrast to these 
previous studies, participants in our study had to search a 
target based on aesthetic judgment. They spent longer gaze 
duration in our task than normal visual search task. These 
differences in the task environment may lead to the 
different results of the effect on search performance. 
Ecological validity is therefore crucial to understanding the 
constraints on visual search strategy.

On the other hand, we have chosen to control some 
variables that are confounded in studies of potential new 
designs. For example, in studies of hyperbolic browsers 
[30] item size and item density are confounded, i.e. items 
that are close together are also smaller than items that are 
further apart. Although this is perhaps, a natural confound 
for systems like hyperbolic browsers, failing to isolate what 
are otherwise independent factors will limit the generality 
of conclusions drawn from the data.
A downside of our effort to engage our participants in a 
meaningful task -- looking for attractive images of potential 
destinations -- was that there was a weak criterion for 
successful trial completion. The trial was over when 
participants indicated that they had found an attractive 
thumbnail but some participants may have used radically 
different thresholds for ‘attractive’ than others. In contrast, 
experiments in which participants were asked to find a 
particular item have a strong and measurable criterion for 
trial completion and moreover participants can make errors. 
Although we claim that our design reflects some part of the 
natural task ecology, it also reduces the strength of the 
conclusions that we can draw from the fact that participants 
took less time, overall, when items were presented with a 
higher density.
Design Implications
A persistent problem for HCI is that the exploration of new 
designs in the absence of adequate empirically grounded 
theory might lead to the rejection of the design on the basis 
of false negatives. Hyperbolic or other fish-eye view 
projections have, for example, had no impact on the way 
that most people use computer systems, despite the huge 
research investment over many years. It is tempting to take 
this fact as evidence that hyperbolic browsers are not fit for 
purpose. However, an alternative reason for their failure to 
find a role might be that the particular design instances are 
not tuned to the detailed constraints and adaptive capability 
of the human visual system. Hyperbolic browsers that fail 
to let people adapt to the constraints and capabilities 
imposed by their visual system are unlikely to succeed. 
Careful empirical investigation in response to well-formed 
theory and motivated by the ecology of user’s real task 
environments may have the potential to address this 
problem.
For example, although users might adapt their search 
strategy to achieve the highest payoff given a particular 
thumbnail density, some layout designs are better for 
decreasing of total search time and manual response time. 
The results reported above suggest the high density (3 
pixels gap between thumbnails) can facilitate search.
Interestingly, even higher densities than we have explored 
in this paper are unlikely to produce further gains. Previous 
work [21] has suggested that when the spacing between 
icons is zero pixels search becomes more difficult. 
Thumbnails require at least some space for visual search, 
which perhaps reflects common intuitions.
