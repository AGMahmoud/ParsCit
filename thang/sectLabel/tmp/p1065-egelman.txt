sectionHeader ||| ABSTRACT
bodyText ||| Many popular web browsers now include active phishing
bodyText ||| warnings since research has shown that passive warnings
bodyText ||| are often ignored. In this laboratory study we examine the
bodyText ||| effectiveness of these warnings and examine if, how, and
bodyText ||| why they fail users. We simulated a spear phishing attack
bodyText ||| to expose users to browser warnings. We found that 97%
bodyText ||| of our sixty participants fell for at least one of the phishing
bodyText ||| messages that we sent them. However, we also found that
bodyText ||| when presented with the active warnings, 79% of partici-
bodyText ||| pants heeded them, which was not the case for the passive
bodyText ||| warning that we tested—where only one participant heeded
bodyText ||| the warnings. Using a model from the warning sciences we
bodyText ||| analyzed how users perceive warning messages and offer
bodyText ||| suggestions for creating more effective phishing warnings.

sectionHeader ||| INTRODUCTION
bodyText ||| Online security indicators have historically failed users be-
bodyText ||| cause users do not understand or believe them. The preva-
bodyText ||| lence of phishing, a scam to collect personal information
bodyText ||| by mimicking trusted websites, has prompted the design of
bodyText ||| many new online security indicators. Because phishing is a
bodyText ||| semantic attack that relies on confusing people, it is difficult
bodyText ||| to automatically detect these attacks with complete accuracy.
bodyText ||| Thus, anti-phishing tools use warnings to alert users to po-
bodyText ||| tential phishing sites, rather than outright blocking them.
bodyText ||| The question remains, do anti-phishing warnings actually
bodyText ||| help users? Up until recently these tools have relied on pas-
bodyText ||| sive indicators to alert users. A passive indicator indicates
bodyText ||| a potential danger by changing colors, providing textual in-
bodyText ||| formation, or by other means without interrupting the user’s

bodyText ||| task. However, research has shown that passive indicators
bodyText ||| are failing users because users often fail to notice them or do
bodyText ||| not trust them [23].
bodyText ||| The newest web browsers now include active warnings, which
bodyText ||| force users to notice the warnings by interrupting them. Mi-
bodyText ||| crosoft’s Internet Explorer 7 includes both active and passive
bodyText ||| phishing warnings (Figures 1 and 2, respectively). When IE7
bodyText ||| encounters a confirmed phishing website, the browser will
bodyText ||| display an active warning message giving the user the op-
bodyText ||| tion of closing the window (recommended) or displaying the
bodyText ||| website (not recommended). This warning is a full screen
bodyText ||| error, which turns the URL bar red if the user chooses to dis-
bodyText ||| play the website (Figure 1). The passive indicator, a popup

bodyText ||| dialog box, is displayed to the user when the browser be-
bodyText ||| lieves a website is suspicious (Figure 2), but that website
bodyText ||| has not been verified as being a phishing website (i.e. it does
bodyText ||| not appear on a blacklist). We consider this warning to be
bodyText ||| more passive because it does not give the user any choices,
bodyText ||| nor does it make any recommendations.
bodyText ||| Firefox 2.0 also includes an active phishing warning, which
bodyText ||| was part of the Google Toolbar extension for previous ver-
bodyText ||| sions of Firefox. When a user encounters a confirmed phish-
bodyText ||| ing website, a non-interactive dimmed version of the web-
bodyText ||| site is displayed with an overlayed dialog box. The user is
bodyText ||| given a choice between continuing to the site or leaving. The
bodyText ||| user may also click the red ‘X’ in the corner of the warning,
bodyText ||| which has the same effect as continuing to the website (Fig-
bodyText ||| ure 3).
bodyText ||| In this study we compared the effectiveness of active and
bodyText ||| passive phishing warnings by analyzing them using a warn-
bodyText ||| ing analysis methodology used by researchers in the warning
bodyText ||| sciences field, called the Communication-Human Informa-
bodyText ||| tion Processing Model (C-HIP) model [21].
bodyText ||| This paper makes three contributions. First, it presents the
bodyText ||| results of a study evaluating the effectiveness of active secu-
bodyText ||| rity indicators in current web browsers. Second, it presents
bodyText ||| an analysis of the results using a model from the warning
bodyText ||| sciences. Third, it presents recommendations for improving
bodyText ||| these security indicators such that fewer users fall victim to
bodyText ||| online fraud.
bodyText ||| We first frame our study within the context of previous phish-
bodyText ||| ing and warning research, and then describe the methodol-
bodyText ||| ogy behind our study. We then discuss the results of our
bodyText ||| user study and how effective we determined each warning
bodyText ||| message to be. Finally, we make recommendations based on
bodyText ||| these results for designing more effective security indicators.
sectionHeader ||| BACKGROUND
bodyText ||| In this section we describe previous work related to users’
bodyText ||| susceptibility to phishing, warning indicators used in web
bodyText ||| browsers, and user perceptions of warning messages.
subsectionHeader ||| Phishing Susceptibility
bodyText ||| Despite growing efforts to educate users and create better
bodyText ||| detection tools, users are still very susceptible to phishing
bodyText ||| attacks. Unfortunately, due to the nature of the attacks, it is
bodyText ||| very difficult to estimate the number of people who actually
bodyText ||| fall victim. A 2006 report by Gartner estimated the costs at
bodyText ||| $1,244 per victim, an increase over the $257 they cited in
bodyText ||| a 2004 report [11]. In 2007 Moore and Clayton estimated
bodyText ||| the number of phishing victims by examining web server
bodyText ||| logs. They estimated that 311,449 people fall for phishing
bodyText ||| scams annually, costing around 350 million dollars [15]. An-
bodyText ||| other study in 2007 by Florencio and Herley estimated that
bodyText ||| roughly 0.4% of the population falls for phishing attacks an-
bodyText ||| nually [9].
bodyText ||| Phishing works because users are willing to trust websites
bodyText ||| that appear to be designed well. In a 2001 study on web-
bodyText ||| site credibility, Fogg et al. found that the “look and feel”
bodyText ||| of a website is often most important for gaining a user’s
bodyText ||| trust [10]. A 2006 phishing study by Dhamija et al. found
bodyText ||| that 90% of the participants were fooled by phishing web-
bodyText ||| sites. The researchers concluded that current security indi-
bodyText ||| cators (i.e. the lock icon, status bar, and address bar) are inef-
bodyText ||| fective because 23% of the participants failed to notice them
bodyText ||| or because they did not understand what they meant [7].
bodyText ||| In a similar study, Downs et al. showed participants eight
bodyText ||| emails, three of which were phishing. They found that the
bodyText ||| number of participants who expressed suspicion varied for
bodyText ||| each email; 47% expressed suspicion over a phishing mes-
bodyText ||| sage from Amazon, whereas 74% expressed suspicion over
bodyText ||| a phishing message from Citibank. Those who had inter-
bodyText ||| acted with certain companies in the past were significantly
bodyText ||| more likely to fall for phishing messages claiming to be from
bodyText ||| these companies. Participants were also likely to ignore or
bodyText ||| misunderstand web browser security cues [8].
subsectionHeader ||| Phishing Indicators
bodyText ||| New research has focused on creating new anti-phishing in-
bodyText ||| dicators because existing security indicators have failed. The
bodyText ||| Passpet system, created by Yee et al. in 2006, uses indicators
bodyText ||| so that users know they are at a previously-trusted website.
bodyText ||| Users can store an animal icon within the web browser for
bodyText ||| each trusted site with which they interact. The system will
bodyText ||| only send a password when the user recognizes that the ani-
bodyText ||| mal icons match. Preliminary user testing suggests that this
bodyText ||| system is easy for users to use [25]. Other proposals have
bodyText ||| also been put forth to modify browser chrome to help users
bodyText ||| detect phishing websites. In one system, “synchronized ran-
bodyText ||| dom dynamic boundaries,” by Ye and Smith, the browser
bodyText ||| chrome is modified to blink at a random rate. If the blink
bodyText ||| rate matches a trusted window’s blink rate, the user knows
bodyText ||| that the window in question has not been spoofed [24]. A
bodyText ||| similar solution using a trusted window was also proposed
bodyText ||| by Dhamija and Tygar in 2005. In their system the chrome
bodyText ||| of the browser window contains a colored pattern that must
bodyText ||| be matched with the trusted window. The user knows to rec-
bodyText ||| ognize the trusted window because it contains a personal im-
bodyText ||| age that the user selected during the initial configuration [6].
bodyText ||| Since all of these proposals require the use of complicated
bodyText ||| third-party tools, it’s unclear how many users will actually
bodyText ||| benefit from them. These proposals have only undergone
bodyText ||| minimal user testing in unrealistic environments. User test-
bodyText ||| ing should be performed under real world conditions before
bodyText ||| any new security indicator is recommended.

bodyText ||| The SiteKey system was introduced in 2005 to simplify au-
bodyText ||| thentication by not forcing the user to install additional soft-
bodyText ||| ware. SiteKey uses a system of visual authentication images
bodyText ||| that are selected by the user at the time of enrollment. When
bodyText ||| the user enters his or her username, the image is displayed.
bodyText ||| If the user recognizes the image as the original shared secret,
bodyText ||| it is safe to enter the password [2]. However, a recent study
bodyText ||| found that 92% of participants still logged in to the website
bodyText ||| using their own credentials when the correct image was not
bodyText ||| present [19]. However, this sample may have been drawn
bodyText ||| from a biased population since others refused to participate,
bodyText ||| citing privacy and security concerns.
bodyText ||| Some argue that the use of extended validation (EV) certifi-
bodyText ||| cates may help users detect phishing websites. An EV cer-
bodyText ||| tificate differs from a standard SSL certificate because the
bodyText ||| website owner must undergo background checks. A regular
bodyText ||| certificate only tells a user that the certificate was granted
bodyText ||| by a particular issuing authority, whereas an EV certificate
bodyText ||| also says that it belongs to a legally recognized company [4].
bodyText ||| The newest version of Microsoft’s Internet Explorer sup-
bodyText ||| ports EV certificates, coloring the URL bar green and dis-
bodyText ||| playing the name of the company. However, a recent study
bodyText ||| found that EV certificates did not make users less likely to
bodyText ||| fall for phishing attacks. The study also found that after
bodyText ||| reading a help file, users were less suspicious of fraudulent
bodyText ||| websites that did not yield warning indicators [13].
bodyText ||| Many web browser extensions for phishing detection cur-
bodyText ||| rently exist. Unfortunately, a recent study on anti-phishing
bodyText ||| toolbar accuracy found that these tools fail to identify a sub-
bodyText ||| stantial proportion of phishing websites [26]. A 2006 study
bodyText ||| by Wu et al. found that the usability of these tools is also
bodyText ||| lacking because many of them use passive indicators. Many
bodyText ||| users fail to notice the indicators, while others often do not
bodyText ||| trust them because they think the sites look trustworthy [23].
sectionHeader ||| A MODEL FOR WARNINGS
bodyText ||| In this paper we will analyze our user study results using
bodyText ||| a model from the warnings sciences. Computer scientists
bodyText ||| can benefit from studies in this field. Many studies have ex-
bodyText ||| amined “hazard matching” and “arousal strength.” Hazard
bodyText ||| matching is defined as accurately using warning messages to
bodyText ||| convey risks—if a warning does not adequately convey risk,
bodyText ||| the user may not take heed of the warning. Arousal strength
bodyText ||| is defined as the perceived urgency of the warning [12].
bodyText ||| To date, few studies have been conducted to evaluate the
bodyText ||| arousal strength of software warnings. In one study of warn-
bodyText ||| ing messages used in Microsoft Windows, researchers found
bodyText ||| that using different combinations of icons and text greatly af-
bodyText ||| fected participants’ risk perceptions. Participants were shown
bodyText ||| a series of dialog boxes with differing text and icons, and
bodyText ||| were instructed to estimate the severity of the warnings us-
bodyText ||| ing a 10-point Likert scale. The choice of icons and words
bodyText ||| greatly affected how each participant ranked the severity.
bodyText ||| The researchers also examined the extent to which individu-
bodyText ||| als will continue to pay attention to a warning after seeing it
bodyText ||| multiple times (“habituation”). They found that users dis-
bodyText ||| missed the warnings without reading them after they had
bodyText ||| seen them multiple times. This behavior continued even
figureCaption ||| Figure 4. Diagram of the different phases of the C-HIP model [21].
bodyText ||| when using a similar but different warning in a different sit-
bodyText ||| uation. The only way of recapturing the user’s attention was
bodyText ||| to increase the arousal strength of the warning [1].
bodyText ||| Wogalter proposed the Communication-Human Information
bodyText ||| Processing Model (C-HIP) for structuring warning research,
bodyText ||| as shown in Figure 4. He suggests that C-HIP be used to
bodyText ||| identify reasons that a particular warning is ineffective [21].
bodyText ||| The C-HIP model begins with a source delivering a warning
bodyText ||| through a channel to a receiver, who receives it along with
bodyText ||| other environmental stimuli that may distract from the mes-
bodyText ||| sage. The receiver goes through five information processing
bodyText ||| steps, which ultimately determine whether the warning re-
bodyText ||| sults in any change in behavior.
bodyText ||| We can ask the following questions to examine the different
bodyText ||| steps in Wogalter’s model [5]:
listItem ||| 1. Attention Switch and Maintenance — Do users notice the
listItem ||| indicators?
listItem ||| 2. Comprehension/Memory — Do users know what the indi-
listItem ||| cators mean?
listItem ||| 3. Comprehension/Memory — Do users know what they are
listItem ||| supposed to do when they see the indicators?
listItem ||| 4. Attitudes/Beliefs — Do they believe the indicators?
listItem ||| 5. Motivation — Are they motivated to take the recommended
listItem ||| actions?
listItem ||| 6. Behavior — Will they actually perform those actions?
listItem ||| 7. Environmental Stimuli — How do the indicators interact
listItem ||| with other indicators and other stimuli?
bodyText ||| Observing users as they complete a task while thinking aloud
bodyText ||| provides insights into most of the above questions. Alterna-
bodyText ||| tively, users can complete tasks and then fill out post-task
bodyText ||| questionnaires or participate in interviews, although these
bodyText ||| require users to remember why they did something and re-
bodyText ||| port it afterwards, and users sometimes say what they think

bodyText ||| the researcher wants to hear. In our study of active phishing
bodyText ||| indicators we performed a think-alound experiment followed
bodyText ||| by a post-task questionnaire. We then used the C-HIP model
bodyText ||| to analyze our data.
sectionHeader ||| METHODOLOGY
bodyText ||| In this study participants made online purchases and then
bodyText ||| were told to check their email, whereupon they encountered
bodyText ||| phishing messages we had sent them. We observed partic-
bodyText ||| ipants visit the URLs in these phishing messages, at which
bodyText ||| point the participants were exposed to the web browser warn-
bodyText ||| ing messages. We took note of whether participants read
bodyText ||| these warnings and how they chose to proceed. Finally, par-
bodyText ||| ticipants were given an exit survey.
bodyText ||| The primary purpose of this study was to examine the effec-
bodyText ||| tiveness of phishing warnings found in current web browsers.
bodyText ||| These warnings serve as the last line of defense against a user
bodyText ||| divulging his or her sensitive information to a con artist. In
bodyText ||| other words, prior to these warnings being displayed, it is
bodyText ||| likely that users believe they are visiting legitimate websites.
bodyText ||| Thus, we needed users to fall for the phishing messages we
bodyText ||| sent them during our study so that they would be in a similar
bodyText ||| state of mind when they encountered the warnings. At the
bodyText ||| same time, we needed our attack to be plausible. Thus, we
bodyText ||| simulated a spear phishing attack. Spear phishing “involves
bodyText ||| personalized emails or emails sent to a specifically targeted
bodyText ||| group, such as employees of a particular organization” [8].
bodyText ||| For instance, a phisher might send a message to email ad-
bodyText ||| dresses at aol.com announcing account changes impacting
bodyText ||| AOL users. Since all the recipients are AOL users, this scam
bodyText ||| may have increased credibility because users believe it to be
bodyText ||| relevant to them. In our study, if participants did not believe
bodyText ||| our phishing messages to be credible, they would be less
bodyText ||| likely to follow the links and thus would not see the browser
bodyText ||| warning messages.
bodyText ||| We framed our study as an “online shopping study”—items
bodyText ||| were purchased online, and then we sent the participants
bodyText ||| phishing messages claiming to be from those shopping web-
bodyText ||| sites. Participants were told that we were examining how
bodyText ||| they interact with shopping websites and that they needed to
bodyText ||| think aloud during their purchases. After the first purchase
bodyText ||| was made, participants checked their email to confirm that
bodyText ||| the order was going to be shipped, thereby encountering the
bodyText ||| first phishing message. Once the participants were confi-
bodyText ||| dent that the first purchase had been completed, instructions
bodyText ||| were provided for the second purchase. This purchase was
bodyText ||| then made using a different website, and a different phishing
bodyText ||| message was sent. Participants in the experimental condi-
bodyText ||| tions were given an exit survey before leaving. In this sec-
bodyText ||| tion we will provide the details of our recruitment process
bodyText ||| and the study design.
subsectionHeader ||| Recruitment
bodyText ||| This study was designed as a between-subjects study, with
bodyText ||| four different conditions using the Internet Explorer 7.0 and
bodyText ||| Firefox 2.0 web browsers: participants were shown either
bodyText ||| the Firefox warning (Figure 3), the active IE warning (Fig-
bodyText ||| ure 1), the passive IE warning (Figure 2), or no warning at
bodyText ||| all. As of June 2007, users of Internet Explorer and Firefox
bodyText ||| comprised 58.5% and 34.0% of all Internet users, respec-
bodyText ||| tively [18]. Additionally, both browsers have automatic up-
bodyText ||| date features. Thus, it is only a matter of time before most
bodyText ||| users will be using the newest versions of these browsers
bodyText ||| which contain these phishing warnings. We began recruiting
bodyText ||| participants in May of 2007.
bodyText ||| We did not tell participants that we were studying online se-
bodyText ||| curity because we wanted to simulate a natural environment
bodyText ||| by not priming them to security concerns. We recruited par-
bodyText ||| ticipants from all over Pittsburgh in order to make our re-
bodyText ||| sults generalizable. We attached flyers to telephone posts,
bodyText ||| bus stops, and community bulletin boards. We also posted
bodyText ||| online to Craigslist and a CMU website for recruiting study
bodyText ||| participants. We constructed a screening survey to screen out
bodyText ||| technically savvy individuals, users of certain web browsers,
bodyText ||| participants in previous phishing studies, and users of certain
bodyText ||| email providers. We also used this survey to glean some ba-
bodyText ||| sic demographic information from participants, such as age,
bodyText ||| gender, occupation, prior online shopping experience, etc.
bodyText ||| Participants who contacted us after seeing a recruitment flyer
bodyText ||| were directed to our online screening survey. Since we were
bodyText ||| examining the newest versions of Firefox (2.0) and IE (7.0)
bodyText ||| to include the active warnings, we made sure that all par-
bodyText ||| ticipants in the experimental conditions already used one of
bodyText ||| these browser versions. Thus the screening survey included
bodyText ||| a question about current browser version (with graphics de-
bodyText ||| picting how to determine the version) to screen out users of
bodyText ||| other web browsers.
bodyText ||| Since our lab has conducted previous studies on phishing,
bodyText ||| we were concerned about the potential for priming of prior
bodyText ||| participants. Thus we disqualified anyone who had previ-
bodyText ||| ously participated in a phishing-related study. We were also
bodyText ||| concerned that savvy users would not believe the emails, and
bodyText ||| thus not be exposed to the warnings. We asked four ques-
bodyText ||| tions to gauge each participant’s experience:
listItem ||| •	Have you ever designed a website?
listItem ||| •	Have you ever registered a domain name?
listItem ||| •	Have you ever used SSH?
listItem ||| •	Have you ever configured a firewall?
bodyText ||| In our pilot we discovered that participants who answered
bodyText ||| yes to all four questions were just as likely to believe the
bodyText ||| phishing emails as all other participants. Thus, we decided
bodyText ||| not to disqualify participants based on these questions.
bodyText ||| We tried to make our scenarios as realistic as possible by
bodyText ||| requiring participants to use their own email accounts and
bodyText ||| financial information for the purchases. The screening sur-
bodyText ||| vey explicitly asked whether or not they could check their
bodyText ||| email using a web browser on a foreign computer. We also
bodyText ||| asked them to enter their email addresses so that we could
bodyText ||| contact them as well as to determine which email provider
bodyText ||| they were using. We initially found that some of the larger
bodyText ||| free email providers were detecting our phishing messages
bodyText ||| and filtering them out. We minimized this problem by im-
bodyText ||| plementing DKIM and SPF on our outgoing mail server to
bodyText ||| help recipient mail servers verify the message sender. 1,2

bodyText ||| Of the 282 individuals who completed our screening sur-
bodyText ||| vey, only 70 qualified and showed up. Despite our efforts
bodyText ||| to screen out individuals who used email providers that were
bodyText ||| likely to filter out our messages, we still found that we could
bodyText ||| not collect data from ten participants because they did not re-
bodyText ||| ceive either of our phishing messages. These ten participants
bodyText ||| were not included in our results.
bodyText ||| Based on the browser versions that they indicated in the
bodyText ||| screening survey, participants were placed in one of the four
bodyText ||| conditions. The average age of participants was 28 (σ =
bodyText ||| 10.58), and there was no significant difference between the
bodyText ||| groups in terms of age or gender. The Firefox condition con-
bodyText ||| sisted of 20 users of Firefox 2.0, while the other two exper-
bodyText ||| imental conditions consisted of users of Internet Explorer
bodyText ||| 7 (20 participants in the active IE condition and 10 partic-
bodyText ||| ipants in the passive IE condition). The ten participants in
bodyText ||| the control group all used an older version of one of the two
bodyText ||| browsers. The control group was used to determine whether
bodyText ||| or not participants were willing to enter information into our
bodyText ||| phishing websites in the absence of any warning messages.
bodyText ||| This told us whether the warning was affecting phishing sus-
bodyText ||| ceptibility or if it could be attributed to some other factor.
bodyText ||| The group sizes were chosen based on a power analysis per-
bodyText ||| formed prior to recruitment.
bodyText ||| We were initially concerned that the self-selected nature of
bodyText ||| the groups (based on web browser preference) may have bi-
bodyText ||| ased our study. However, we found no statistical differences
bodyText ||| between the average number of hours participants in each
bodyText ||| group claimed to use the Internet, nor with regard to the av-
bodyText ||| erage number of email messages participants claimed to re-
bodyText ||| ceive. In each of the active warning groups, exactly seven
bodyText ||| participants answered “no” to all of the questions used to
bodyText ||| gauge technical prowess. Thus, there were equal numbers of
bodyText ||| novices in each group.
subsectionHeader ||| Scenarios
bodyText ||| We decided to spoof Amazon and eBay since they were the
bodyText ||| most commonly phished non-bank websites [17]. Thus, re-
bodyText ||| gardless of familiarity with the real websites, it is likely that
bodyText ||| participants have previously encountered phishing messages
bodyText ||| claiming to be from these websites. Our spoofed websites
bodyText ||| consisted of login forms for usernames and passwords. To
bodyText ||| make these websites look authentic, we registered two do-
bodyText ||| main names: ebay-login.net and amazonaccounts.net. The
bodyText ||| websites were designed to mimic the login pages of the orig-
bodyText ||| inal websites. We created two spoof URLs at each domain
bodyText ||| name.
bodyText ||| We took steps to ensure our phishing websites triggered the
bodyText ||| warnings in each web browser. Firefox downloads its lo-
bodyText ||| cally stored blacklist from Google, so we modified it locally
bodyText ||| to include our URLs [16]. Microsoft agreed to add our spoof
bodyText ||| URLs to their remote blacklists, causing those URLs to trig-
bodyText ||| ger the IE phishing warnings.
bodyText ||| We copied two common phishing emails spoofing Amazon
bodyText ||| and eBay and changed the content to fit our study. The
bodyText ||| message claiming to be from Amazon was sent out in plain
bodyText ||| text and informed the recipient that the order was delayed
bodyText ||| and would be cancelled unless the recipient clicked the in-
bodyText ||| cluded URL. The message claiming to be from eBay was in
bodyText ||| HTML and informed the recipient that all international or-
bodyText ||| ders needed to be confirmed by visiting a URL contained
bodyText ||| within the message. Both messages contained random or-
bodyText ||| der numbers to help convince the recipients of their legit-
bodyText ||| imacy, though no information specific to the recipients was
bodyText ||| included in these messages in order to make our attacks real-
bodyText ||| istic. The scenario was such that it would have been entirely
bodyText ||| possible for a person to have just completed a purchase from
bodyText ||| one of these websites and then received a generic phishing
bodyText ||| message spoofing that same website. It is also possible for
bodyText ||| a phisher to monitor wireless Internet traffic and conduct a
bodyText ||| similar phishing attack after detecting a purchase. We be-
bodyText ||| lieve that the coincidental nature of this attack was the reason
bodyText ||| why many more participants fell for our attacks than what
bodyText ||| has been found in similar studies [8, 7, 19, 14, 20]. Previous
bodyText ||| phishing studies have spoofed companies with whom vic-
bodyText ||| tims had relationships. However we are unaware of any user
bodyText ||| studies that have used phishing messages timed to coincide
bodyText ||| with a transaction with the spoofed brand.
bodyText ||| Participants arrived at our laboratory and were told that they
bodyText ||| would be purchasing two items online from Amazon and
bodyText ||| eBay. We randomized the order in which the purchases were
bodyText ||| made. We also informed participants that we were recording
bodyText ||| them, so they needed to think aloud about everything they
bodyText ||| were doing. Participants did the study individually with the
bodyText ||| experimenter sitting behind them in the laboratory.
bodyText ||| We were concerned that if we allowed participants to pur-
bodyText ||| chase whatever they wanted, they might take too long to de-
bodyText ||| cide, and that other factors might confound our results. We
bodyText ||| also wanted participants to focus on buying cheap items so
bodyText ||| that we could reimburse them for both purchases while still
bodyText ||| giving them enough additional money for their time. We lim-
bodyText ||| ited the scope of the purchases by asking them to purchase a
bodyText ||| box of paper clips from Amazon, which cost roughly $0.50,
bodyText ||| plus around $6 in shipping (the exact prices changed with
bodyText ||| each order since all participants did not purchase the same
bodyText ||| paperclips). We asked participants to make their eBay pur-
bodyText ||| chases from a cheap electronics store based in Hong Kong
bodyText ||| that sold a variety of items for around $5-$10, including
bodyText ||| shipping. Participants were compensated $35 for their time
bodyText ||| and the purchases, which were made using their personal
bodyText ||| credit cards.
bodyText ||| After each purchase, participants received a sheet of five
bodyText ||| questions relating to shopping. These questions were part
bodyText ||| of an unrelated study on shopping behaviors, but helped our
bodyText ||| study by convincing participants that this was indeed a shop-
bodyText ||| ping study. While the participant answered these questions,
bodyText ||| the experimenter sent them a phishing message. We con-
bodyText ||| structed a web interface for the study, so that the experi-
bodyText ||| menter only needed to enter an email address, the brand to
bodyText ||| spoof, and the experimental condition.
bodyText ||| After the written questions were completed, the experimenter
bodyText ||| told the participant to “check your email to make sure that
bodyText ||| the order is confirmed and ready to ship so we can move
bodyText ||| on.” When participants checked their email, they encoun-
bodyText ||| tered legitimate messages relating to their orders as well as
bodyText ||| a phishing message. After examining (and reacting) to all of

bodyText ||| the messages, participants received a set of instructions for
bodyText ||| the second purchase. After participants checked their email
bodyText ||| after the second purchase (thereby encountering the second
bodyText ||| phishing message), an exit survey was administered. This
bodyText ||| online exit survey contained questions about participants’ re-
bodyText ||| actions to the warning messages. The experimenter observed
bodyText ||| participants fill this out and asked followup questions if any
bodyText ||| of the responses were too terse or did not seem to follow
bodyText ||| the behaviors exhibited during the experiment. Those in the
bodyText ||| control group were not asked to complete an exit survey as
bodyText ||| they had not seen any warnings. Participants took an aver-
bodyText ||| age of forty minutes to complete all the tasks and were given
bodyText ||| $35 in cash before leaving.
bodyText ||| We were initially concerned that since participants did not
bodyText ||| explicitly want the items, the results might be skewed in fa-
bodyText ||| vor of participants acting more cautious. However, we be-
bodyText ||| lieve their desire to complete the study negated this. Thus,
bodyText ||| the desire to buy the items to complete the study was likely
bodyText ||| just as strong as if the participant were at home purchasing
bodyText ||| a desired item. Additionally, we do not believe that the cost
bodyText ||| of the items played any role since an attacker could use the
bodyText ||| stolen account credentials to make any number of larger pur-
bodyText ||| chases.
sectionHeader ||| RESULTS AND ANALYSIS
bodyText ||| Overall we found that participants were highly susceptible
bodyText ||| to our spear phishing attack. However, users of the active
bodyText ||| phishing warnings were largely protected, since 79% chose
bodyText ||| to heed them. We found a significant difference between
bodyText ||| the active IE and Firefox warnings (p < 0.0004 for Fisher’s
bodyText ||| exact test) as well as no significant difference between the
bodyText ||| passive IE warning and the control group (i.e. significantly
bodyText ||| more users were helped by the active Firefox warning than
bodyText ||| the active IE warning, while the passive IE warning is no dif-
bodyText ||| ferent than not displaying any warning). We also found sig-
bodyText ||| nificant differences between the active IE warning and the
bodyText ||| control group (p < 0.01) demonstrating that the active IE
bodyText ||| warning is still significantly better than not displaying any
bodyText ||| warning. Table 1 depicts these results. In this section we ex-
bodyText ||| amine how participants reacted to the initial phishing mes-
bodyText ||| sages, and then we use the C-HIP model to analyze why
bodyText ||| certain warnings performed better than others.
subsectionHeader ||| Phishing Susceptibility
bodyText ||| Our simulated spear phishing attack was highly effective:
bodyText ||| of the 106 phishing messages that reached participants’ in-
bodyText ||| boxes, participants clicked the URLs of 94 of them (89%).
bodyText ||| While all participants made purchases from both Amazon
bodyText ||| and eBay, not every participant received both of our phish-
bodyText ||| ing messages due to email filtering. Only two participants
bodyText ||| (3%) did not attempt to visit any of the phishing URLs. Of
bodyText ||| the 46 participants who received both phishing messages, 43
bodyText ||| clicked the Amazon link and 37 clicked the eBay link. How-
bodyText ||| ever this difference was not statistically significant, nor were
bodyText ||| there any significant correlations based on which phishing
bodyText ||| message was viewed first. It should also be noted that every
bodyText ||| participant in the control group who followed a link from an
bodyText ||| email message also submitted information to the phishing
bodyText ||| websites (Table 1). Thus, in the absence of security indica-
bodyText ||| tors, it is likely that this type of phishing attack could have a
bodyText ||| success rate of at least 89%.
bodyText ||| With regard to the technical questions mentioned in the Re-
bodyText ||| cruitment section, we noticed a negative trend between tech-
bodyText ||| nical experience and obeying the warnings among Internet
bodyText ||| Explorer users (i.e. users with more technical experience
bodyText ||| were more likely to ignore the warnings). With Firefox,
bodyText ||| technical experience played no role: all users obeyed the
bodyText ||| warnings regardless of their technical experience.
bodyText ||| We did not actually collect any information entered into the
bodyText ||| phishing websites. Instead the experimenter observed each
bodyText ||| participant and noted when they submitted information. Thus
bodyText ||| we cannot conclusively say whether all participants entered
bodyText ||| their correct information. However, the experimenter did
bodyText ||| note that all usernames were entered correctly, and no partic-
bodyText ||| ipants denied entering their correct information when asked
bodyText ||| in the exit survey.
bodyText ||| We found that participants had very inaccurate mental mod-
bodyText ||| els of phishing. Both of our phishing messages contained
bodyText ||| language that said the orders would be cancelled if they did
bodyText ||| not visit the URLs. Thirty-two percent of the participants
bodyText ||| who heeded the warnings and left the phishing websites be-
bodyText ||| lieved that their orders would be cancelled as a result—they
bodyText ||| believed that the emails were really sent from eBay and Ama-
bodyText ||| zon. We asked 25 of the participants how they believed
bodyText ||| the fraudulent URLs came to them, and only three recog-
bodyText ||| nized that the emails had been sent by someone not affiliated
bodyText ||| with either eBay or Amazon (we added this question halfway
bodyText ||| through the study). Thus, there seems to be some cognitive
bodyText ||| dissonance between recognizing a fraudulent website and
bodyText ||| the fraudulent email that spread it. This raises grave con-
bodyText ||| cerns about Internet users’ susceptibility to phishing. Highly
bodyText ||| targeted phishing attacks will continue to be very effective as
bodyText ||| long as users do not understand how easy it is to forge email.
bodyText ||| At the same time, effective browser warnings may mitigate
bodyText ||| the need for user education, as we will now show.
subsectionHeader ||| Attention Switch and Maintenance
bodyText ||| The first stage in the C-HIP model is “attention switch.” If
bodyText ||| a warning is unable to capture the user’s attention, the warn-
bodyText ||| ing will not be noticed and thus be rendered useless. Unlike
bodyText ||| the passive indicators examined by Wu et al. [23], the ac-
bodyText ||| tive warnings in Firefox and Internet Explorer get the user’s
bodyText ||| attention by interrupting their task—the user is forced to
bodyText ||| choose one of the options presented by the warning.

tableCaption ||| Table 2. This table depicts the number of participants in each experi-
bodyText ||| mental condition, the number who saw at least one warning, the num-
bodyText ||| ber who completely read at least one warning, the number who recog-
bodyText ||| nized the warnings, the number who correctly understood the warn-
bodyText ||| ings, and the number who understood the choices that the warnings
bodyText ||| presented.
bodyText ||| This was not the case with the passive warning in IE (Figure
bodyText ||| 2). This warning is a single dialog box with only the op-
bodyText ||| tion to dismiss it. We observed that it could take up to five
bodyText ||| seconds for this warning to appear. If a user starts typing
bodyText ||| during this period, the user’s keystrokes will inadvertently
bodyText ||| dismiss the warning. Six of the ten participants in this con-
bodyText ||| dition never noticed the warning because their focus was on
bodyText ||| either the keyboard or the input box. Two of these partic-
bodyText ||| ipants had this happen on both phishing websites, so they
bodyText ||| had no idea they were ever exposed to any warnings. We
bodyText ||| found no statistical significance between this condition and
bodyText ||| the control group. Thus, this type of warning is effectively
bodyText ||| useless.
bodyText ||| Effective warnings must also cause attention maintenance—
bodyText ||| they must grab the users’ attention long enough for them to
bodyText ||| attempt comprehension. We examined the number of partici-
bodyText ||| pants who read the warnings (as determined by self-reporting
bodyText ||| and confirmed by the observations of the experimenter) in
bodyText ||| order to determine their effectiveness at attention mainte-
bodyText ||| nance. Table 2 shows the number of warnings read and the
bodyText ||| number of participants who claimed to have seen the warn-
bodyText ||| ings prior to this study, for each experimental condition.
bodyText ||| Not counting the two participants who failed to notice the
bodyText ||| warnings entirely, and the participant in the active IE condi-
bodyText ||| tion who did not click on the URLs, we found that twenty-six
bodyText ||| of the remaining forty-seven (55%) claimed to have com-
bodyText ||| pletely read at least one of the warnings that were displayed.
bodyText ||| When asked, twenty-two of these twenty-six (85%) said they
bodyText ||| decided to read the warning because it appeared to warn
bodyText ||| about some sort of negative consequences.
bodyText ||| Upon seeing the warnings, two participants in the active IE
bodyText ||| condition immediately closed the window. They went back
bodyText ||| to the emails and clicked the links, were presented with the
bodyText ||| same warnings, and then closed the windows again. They
bodyText ||| repeated this process four or five times before giving up,
bodyText ||| though never bothered to read the warnings. Both said that
bodyText ||| the websites were not working. Despite not reading or un-
bodyText ||| derstanding the warnings, both were protected because the
bodyText ||| warnings “failed safely.” Thus, if users do not read or under-
bodyText ||| stand the warnings, the warnings can still be designed such
bodyText ||| that the user is likely to take the recommended action.
bodyText ||| Nineteen participants claimed to have previously seen these
bodyText ||| particular warnings. A significantly higher proportion of
bodyText ||| participants in the active IE condition (50%) claimed to have
bodyText ||| recognized the warnings as compared to participants in the
bodyText ||| Firefox condition (20%; p < 0.048 for Fisher’s exact test).
bodyText ||| Many of the participants who encountered the active IE warn-
bodyText ||| ing said that they had previously seen the same warning on
bodyText ||| websites which they trusted, and thus they ignored it. It is
bodyText ||| likely that they did not read this phishing warning because
bodyText ||| IE uses a similar warning when it encounters an expired or
bodyText ||| self-signed SSL certificate. Therefore they did not notice
bodyText ||| that this was a slightly different and more serious warning.
bodyText ||| We found a significant negative Pearson correlation between
bodyText ||| participants recognizing a warning message and their will-
bodyText ||| ingness to completely read it (r = —0.309, p < 0.03).
bodyText ||| This implies that if a warning is recognized, a user is sig-
bodyText ||| nificantly less likely to bother to read it completely (i.e. ha-
bodyText ||| bituation). Thus, very serious warnings should be designed
bodyText ||| differently than less serious warnings in order to increase the
bodyText ||| likelihood that users will read them. This was also the basis
bodyText ||| for Brustoloni and Villamar´ın-Salom´on’s work on dynamic
bodyText ||| warnings [3].
subsectionHeader ||| Warning Comprehension
bodyText ||| A well-designed warning must convey a sense of danger and
bodyText ||| present suggested actions. In this study we asked partici-
bodyText ||| pants what they believed each warning meant. Twenty-seven
bodyText ||| of the 47 participants (57%) who saw at least one of the
bodyText ||| warnings correctly said they believed that they had some-
bodyText ||| thing to do with giving information to fraudulent websites
bodyText ||| (Table 2). Of the 20 participants who did not understand the
bodyText ||| meaning of the warnings, one said that she did not see it long
bodyText ||| enough to have any idea, while the others had widely varying
bodyText ||| answers. Examples include: “someone got my password,”
bodyText ||| “[it] was not very serious like most window[s] warning[s],”
bodyText ||| and “there was a lot of security because the items were cheap
bodyText ||| and because they were international.”
bodyText ||| Using Fisher’s exact test, we found that those using Firefox
bodyText ||| understood the meaning of the warnings significantly more
bodyText ||| than those exposed to the active IE warnings (p < 0.041)
bodyText ||| and the passive IE warnings (p < 0.005), though we found
bodyText ||| no significant difference between the active and passive IE
bodyText ||| warnings. We found a significant Pearson correlation be-
bodyText ||| tween completely reading a warning and understanding its
bodyText ||| meaning for the active IE warning (r = 0.478, p < 0.039),
bodyText ||| but not for Firefox. Since all but one Firefox user correctly
bodyText ||| understood what the warning wanted them to do, this im-
bodyText ||| plies that users did not need to completely read it to know
bodyText ||| the appropriate actions to take.
bodyText ||| Overall, 31 of the 47 participants who noticed the warnings
bodyText ||| mentioned that they thought they were supposed to leave
bodyText ||| the website or refrain from entering personal information.
bodyText ||| Those who did not understand the warnings provided re-
bodyText ||| sponses such as “panic and cancel my accounts,” “confirm
bodyText ||| information about the orders,” and “put in my account infor-
bodyText ||| mation so that they could track it and use it for themselves.”

subsectionHeader ||| Attitudes and Beliefs
bodyText ||| We asked participants how their attitudes and beliefs influ-
bodyText ||| enced their perceptions and found a highly significant corre-
bodyText ||| lation between trusting and obeying the warnings (i.e. users
bodyText ||| who did not trust the warnings were likely to ignore them;
bodyText ||| r = 0.76, p < 0.0001). More telling, all but three partic-
bodyText ||| ipants who ignored a warning said it was because they did
bodyText ||| not trust the warning. Two of the participants who ignored
bodyText ||| the warnings in the active IE group said they did so because
bodyText ||| they trusted them but thought the warnings were not very se-
bodyText ||| vere (“since it gave me the option of still proceeding to the
bodyText ||| website, I figured it couldn’t be that bad”). The other par-
bodyText ||| ticipant who trusted the warning yet ignored it was in the
bodyText ||| passive IE group and blamed habituation (“my own PC con-
bodyText ||| stantly bombards me with similar messages”). All three of
bodyText ||| these participants questioned the likelihood of the risks, and
bodyText ||| thus were more interested in completing the primary task.
bodyText ||| We found a significant correlation between recognizing and
bodyText ||| ignoring a warning (r = 0.506, p < 0.0003). This fur-
bodyText ||| ther implies that habituation was to blame when participants
bodyText ||| ignored warnings: they confused them with similar look-
bodyText ||| ing, but less serious warnings, and thus did not understand
bodyText ||| the level of risk that these warnings were trying to convey.
bodyText ||| This was only a problem for the warnings used by IE, as
bodyText ||| all the Firefox users obeyed the warnings (though only 20%
bodyText ||| claimed to have seen them before, compared to the 50% with
bodyText ||| IE). The IE users who ignored the warnings made comments
bodyText ||| such as:
listItem ||| •	“Oh, I always ignore those”
listItem ||| •	“Looked like warnings I see at work which I know to ig-
listItem ||| nore”
listItem ||| •	“Have seen this warning before and [it] was in all cases
listItem ||| [a] false positive”
listItem ||| •	“I’ve already seen such warnings pop up for some other
listItem ||| CMU web pages as well”
listItem ||| •	“I see them daily”
listItem ||| •	“I thought that the warnings were some usual ones dis-
listItem ||| played by IE”
bodyText ||| A warning should not require domain knowledge for a user
bodyText ||| to understand it. In order to examine whether prior knowl-
bodyText ||| edge of phishing impacted user attitudes towards the warn-
bodyText ||| ings, we asked them to define the term “phishing.” Twenty-
bodyText ||| six of the forty-seven participants who noticed the warn-
bodyText ||| ings were able to correctly say they had something to do
bodyText ||| with using fraudulent websites to steal personal information.
bodyText ||| We calculated Pearson’s correlation coefficient and found
bodyText ||| a significant correlation between knowing what phishing is
bodyText ||| and both reading (r = 0.487, p < 0.0005) and heeding
bodyText ||| (r = 0.406, p < 0.005) the warnings. Thus, if a user does
bodyText ||| not understand what phishing is, they are less likely to be
bodyText ||| concerned with the consequences, and thus less likely to pay
bodyText ||| attention to the warning.
subsectionHeader ||| Motivation and Warning Behaviors
bodyText ||| Table 1 depicts the number of participants from each condi-
bodyText ||| tion who fell for at least one phishing message. Some partic-
bodyText ||| ipants only clicked on one of the two phishing messages, and
bodyText ||| in other cases some participants only received one phishing
bodyText ||| message due to email filtering.
bodyText ||| Overall we found that active phishing warnings were signifi-
bodyText ||| cantly more effective than passive warnings (p < 0.0002 for
bodyText ||| Fisher’s exact test). We showed the passive Internet Explorer
bodyText ||| warning to ten different participants, but only one participant
bodyText ||| heeded it and closed the website, whereas the other times
bodyText ||| participants dismissed it and submitted personal information
bodyText ||| to the phishing websites (in two of these cases participants
bodyText ||| failed to notice the warnings altogether). We found that this
bodyText ||| passive warning did not perform significantly different than
bodyText ||| the control group (p < 1.0 for Fisher’s exact test). The ac-
bodyText ||| tive IE warning was ignored by nine participants, while in
bodyText ||| the Firefox condition every participant heeded the warning
bodyText ||| and navigated away from the phishing websites. This was a
bodyText ||| highly significant difference (p < 0.0004, for Fisher’s exact
bodyText ||| test), however the active IE warning still performed signifi-
bodyText ||| cantly better than the control condition (p < 0.01) and the
bodyText ||| passive IE warning (p < 0.044).
bodyText ||| Qualitatively, we examined why participants were motivated
bodyText ||| to heed or ignore the warnings. A total of thirty-one partic-
bodyText ||| ipants chose to heed the warnings, and in twenty-three of
bodyText ||| these cases participants said that the warnings made them
bodyText ||| think about risks:
listItem ||| •	“I didn’t want to get burned”
listItem ||| •	“...it is not necessary to run the risk of letting other poten-
listItem ||| tially dangerous sites to get my information”
listItem ||| •	“I chose to heed the warning since I don’t like to gamble
listItem ||| with the little money I have”
listItem ||| •	“I felt it better to be safe than sorry”
listItem ||| •	“I heeded the warning because it seemed less risky than
listItem ||| ignoring it”
bodyText ||| Participants who chose to submit information said that they
bodyText ||| did so because they were unaware of the risks (i.e. they did
bodyText ||| not read the warnings), were used to ignoring similarly de-
bodyText ||| signed warnings (i.e. habituation), or they did not under-
bodyText ||| stand the choices that the warnings presented.
subsectionHeader ||| Environmental Stimuli
bodyText ||| In the passive IE condition, three of the participants who ig-
bodyText ||| nored the warnings said they did so because they incorrectly
bodyText ||| placed some degree of trust in the phishing website because
bodyText ||| of stimuli other than the warning messages. When asked
bodyText ||| why they chose to ignore the warnings, one participant said
bodyText ||| she had “confidence in the website.” Another participant
bodyText ||| ignored the warning “because I trust the website that I am
bodyText ||| doing the online purchase at.” These answers corroborate
bodyText ||| Fogg’s work, showing that the look and feel of a website
bodyText ||| is often the biggest trust factor [10]. Participants who ig-
bodyText ||| nored the active IE warning provided similar answers, and
bodyText ||| also said that they ignored the warnings because they trusted
bodyText ||| the brands that the emails had spoofed.
bodyText ||| We also found that when some participants saw the warn-
bodyText ||| ings, they examined other security context information be-
bodyText ||| fore making a decision. One Firefox user reexamined the
bodyText ||| original phishing email and noticed the lack of any person-
bodyText ||| alized information. She then decided to “back out and log
bodyText ||| in from the root domain to check.” After seeing the warn-
bodyText ||| ings, ten other Firefox users also examined either the URL
bodyText ||| bar or the email headers. Some observations included: “The
page ||| 1072
note ||| CHI 2008 Proceedings · Am I Safe	April 5-10, 2008 · Florence, Italy
bodyText ||| URL did not match the usual eBay URL and so it could be
bodyText ||| fraudulent;” “I did look at the URL that I opened from the
bodyText ||| email, and the sender of the email, to confirm that they did
bodyText ||| look suspicious;” and “it made me look at the web address
bodyText ||| which was wrong.” One participant in the passive IE con-
bodyText ||| dition and three in the active IE condition incorrectly used
bodyText ||| this information to fall for the phishing attacks. Some of
bodyText ||| the comments included: “The address in the browser was
bodyText ||| of amazonaccounts.com which is a genuine address” and “I
bodyText ||| looked at the URL and it looked okay.”
bodyText ||| Finally, at least four participants claimed that the timing of
bodyText ||| the phishing emails with the purchases contributed to them
bodyText ||| ignoring the warnings. It is unclear how susceptible these
bodyText ||| participants would have been to a broader phishing attack,
bodyText ||| rather than the targeted attack that we examined.
sectionHeader ||| DISCUSSION
bodyText ||| In this section we provide some recommendations for im-
bodyText ||| proving the design of phishing indicators based on the results
bodyText ||| of our study.
bodyText ||| Interrupting the primary task — Phishing indicators need
bodyText ||| to be designed to interrupt the user’s task. We found that the
bodyText ||| passive indicator, which did not interrupt the user’s task, was
bodyText ||| not significantly different than not providing any warning.
bodyText ||| The active warnings were effective because they facilitated
bodyText ||| attention switch and maintenance.
bodyText ||| Providing clear choices — Phishing indicators need to pro-
bodyText ||| vide the user with clear options on how to proceed, rather
bodyText ||| than simply displaying a block of text. The users that no-
bodyText ||| ticed the passive Internet Explorer warning, read it but ig-
bodyText ||| nored it because they did not understand what they were sup-
bodyText ||| posed to do. They understood it had something to do with
bodyText ||| security, but they did not know how to proceed. In contrast,
bodyText ||| the active warnings presented choices and recommendations
bodyText ||| which were largely heeded. Wu found similar results with
bodyText ||| regard to providing users with clear choices [22].
bodyText ||| Failing safely — Phishing indicators must be designed such
bodyText ||| that one can only proceed to the phishing website after read-
bodyText ||| ing the warning message. Users of the active Internet Ex-
bodyText ||| plorer warning who did not read the warning or choices could
bodyText ||| only close the window to get rid of the message. This pre-
bodyText ||| vented them from accessing the page without reviewing the
bodyText ||| warning’s recommendations. However, users of the passive
bodyText ||| Internet Explorer warning had the option of clicking the fa-
bodyText ||| miliar ‘X’ in the corner to dismiss it without reading it, and
bodyText ||| accessing the page anyway.
bodyText ||| Preventing habituation — Phishing indicators need to be
bodyText ||| distinguishable from less serious warnings and used only
bodyText ||| when there is a clear danger. Users ignored the passive in-
bodyText ||| dicators because they looked like many other warnings that
bodyText ||| users have ignored without consequences, thus they appear
bodyText ||| to be “crying wolf.” Even the active Internet Explorer warn-
bodyText ||| ing was not read in a few cases because users mistook it for
bodyText ||| other IE warnings. More people read the Firefox warnings
bodyText ||| because they are designed unlike any other warnings. Dy-
bodyText ||| namic warning messages may help prevent habituation [3].
bodyText ||| Altering the phishing website — Phishing indicators need to
bodyText ||| distort the look and feel of the website such that the user does
bodyText ||| not place trust in it. This can be accomplished by altering its
bodyText ||| look or simply not displaying it at all. The overall look and
bodyText ||| feel of a website is usually the primary factor when users
bodyText ||| make trust decisions [10]. When the website was displayed
bodyText ||| alongside the passive indicators, users ignored the warnings
bodyText ||| because they said that they trusted the look of the website.
sectionHeader ||| CONCLUSION
bodyText ||| This study has given us insights into creating effective se-
bodyText ||| curity indicators within the context of phishing. Such in-
bodyText ||| dicators are clearly needed as 97% of participants believed
bodyText ||| the phishing emails enough to visit the URLs. Of the par-
bodyText ||| ticipants who saw the active warnings, 79% chose to heed
bodyText ||| them and close the phishing websites, whereas only 13% of
bodyText ||| those who saw the passive warnings obeyed them. Without
bodyText ||| the active warning indicators, it is likely that most partici-
bodyText ||| pants would have entered personal information. However,
bodyText ||| the active indicators did not perform equally: the indica-
bodyText ||| tors used by Firefox performed significantly better than the
bodyText ||| active warnings used by IE, though both performed signif-
bodyText ||| icantly better than the passive IE warnings (which was not
bodyText ||| significantly different from not showing any warnings in the
bodyText ||| control group).
bodyText ||| As phishing attacks continue to evolve, it is likely that highly
bodyText ||| targeted attacks will become more prevalent. Future indica-
bodyText ||| tors within the phishing context need to be designed such
bodyText ||| that they interrupt the user’s primary task, clearly convey the
bodyText ||| recommended actions to take, fail in a secure manner if the
bodyText ||| user does not understand or ignores them, draw trust away
bodyText ||| from the suspected phishing website, and prevent the user
bodyText ||| from becoming habituated.
