sectionHeader ||| ABSTRACT
bodyText ||| This paper investigates the uses of social networking site
bodyText ||| Facebook, and the gratifications users derive from those
bodyText ||| uses. In the first study, 137 users generated words or
bodyText ||| phrases to describe how they used Facebook, and what they
bodyText ||| enjoyed about their use. These phrases were coded into 46
bodyText ||| items which were completed by 241 Facebook users in
bodyText ||| Study 2. Factor analysis identified seven unique uses and
bodyText ||| gratifications: social connection, shared identities, content,
bodyText ||| social investigation, social network surfing and status
bodyText ||| updating. User demographics, site visit patterns and the use
bodyText ||| of privacy settings were associated with different uses and
bodyText ||| gratifications.

sectionHeader ||| INTRODUCTION
bodyText ||| Social networking sites such as MySpace, LinkedIn and
bodyText ||| Facebook have become hugely popular in the last few
bodyText ||| years. In July 2007, social networking sites occupied five of
bodyText ||| the top fifteen visited websites according to Alexa.com. On
bodyText ||| July 10, 2007, Facebook.com reported signing up its 30
bodyText ||| millionth user, with a year on year increase in unique users
bodyText ||| of 89% [12]. In the UK, use of Facebook increased by
bodyText ||| 500% between November 2006 and May 2007 [19].
bodyText ||| MySpace is reported (although disputed [10]) to have over
bodyText ||| 100 million users [4].

bodyText ||| Social networking sites typically provide users with a
bodyText ||| profile space, facilities for uploading content (e.g. photos,
bodyText ||| music), messaging in various forms and the ability to make
bodyText ||| connections to other people. These connections (or
bodyText ||| ‘friends’) are the core functionality of a social network site
bodyText ||| [5, 6] although most also provide opportunities for
bodyText ||| communication, the forming of groups, hosting of content
bodyText ||| and small applications.
bodyText ||| Given the growth of social networking sites, it is perhaps
bodyText ||| unsurprising that their use has garnered media attention,
bodyText ||| including the seemingly now obligatory scare stories
bodyText ||| involving predatory child sex offenders [20], identity theft
bodyText ||| [1], workplace usage levels [9] and even addiction [8].
bodyText ||| In many recent cases, this coverage has focused on
bodyText ||| Facebook.com, which was originally restricted to users with
bodyText ||| an ‘.edu’ e-mail address. In September 2006, Facebook
bodyText ||| opened registration to non-college based users. This change
bodyText ||| led to rapid growth in the number of users, as well as
bodyText ||| almost viral growth within non-educational organizations.
bodyText ||| For instance, the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC)
bodyText ||| network (which requires a BBC email address) has circa
bodyText ||| 10,000 members, approximately 50% of employees [21].
bodyText ||| Since May 2007, Facebook has also allowed the
bodyText ||| development and implementation of third-party applications
bodyText ||| (see dev.facebook.com).
bodyText ||| Before opening to non-academic (and non-US-based) users,
bodyText ||| Facebook.com was peculiar amongst social networking
bodyText ||| sites since many of the social networks its users built were
bodyText ||| based on offline, geographically confined groups (e.g. a
bodyText ||| campus). Termed ‘networks’ by the site (which have
bodyText ||| recently expanded to include non-university based
bodyText ||| geographic areas and workplaces), this reflection of the
bodyText ||| offline community in the online environment may have led
bodyText ||| to unique forms of use amongst users [17].
subsectionHeader ||| User motivation and social networking sites
bodyText ||| Social networks serve a number of functions in offline life –
bodyText ||| for instance, providing social and emotional support,
bodyText ||| information resources and ties to other people [25]. Similar
bodyText ||| kinds of social networks have been identified in online
page ||| 1027
note ||| CHI 2008 Proceedings · Online Social Networks	April 5-10, 2008 · Florence, Italy
bodyText ||| communities [7, 25], with users turning online for both
bodyText ||| emotional support and as an information resource (e.g. via a
bodyText ||| mailing list). In both cases, an online social network may
bodyText ||| provide users with social capital [7].
bodyText ||| Online social networking sites may also serve a number of
bodyText ||| other purposes [5, 16]. Lampe et al. [16] draw a distinction
bodyText ||| between the use of Facebook for ‘social searching’ –
bodyText ||| finding out information about offline contacts, and ‘social
bodyText ||| browsing’ – the use of the site to develop new connections,
bodyText ||| sometimes with the aim of offline interaction. A survey of
bodyText ||| over 2,000 students, found evidence that the primary use of
bodyText ||| Facebook was for ‘social searching’ – that is, using
bodyText ||| Facebook to find out more about people who they have met
bodyText ||| offline, or who they attend class or share a dormitory with
bodyText ||| [16]. The use of Facebook for ‘social browsing’, for
bodyText ||| instance, to meet someone via the site with the intention of
bodyText ||| a later offline meeting, or to attend an event organized
bodyText ||| online, scored relatively low amongst their sample. The
bodyText ||| main use reported by the sample studied by Lampe et al.
bodyText ||| [16, see also 7] was to, “keep in touch with an old friend or
bodyText ||| someone I knew from high school”, an activity that while
bodyText ||| expressing the offline aspects of social searching, also
bodyText ||| suggests a social capital function for Facebook. Golder et
bodyText ||| al. [11] report that while the vast majority of messages are
bodyText ||| sent to friends (90.6%), a large proportion (41.6%) is sent
bodyText ||| to friends outside of one’s local network. This suggests that
bodyText ||| messaging is used to maintain and build social ties across
bodyText ||| distances. In comparison, ‘pokes’ (a form of content-free
bodyText ||| messaging) were primarily exchanged within a network /
bodyText ||| school (98.3% of all pokes were within a network). Golder
bodyText ||| et al. [11] argue that friendship ties require little effort or
bodyText ||| investment to maintain, while messaging with
bodyText ||| geographically distant friends is used to build social capital
bodyText ||| [7].
bodyText ||| According to Lampe et al. [16], social networking sites like
bodyText ||| Facebook may also serve a surveillance function, allowing
bodyText ||| users to “track the actions, beliefs and interests of the larger
bodyText ||| groups to which they belong” (p. 167). The surveillance and
bodyText ||| ‘social search’ functions of Facebook may, in part, explain
bodyText ||| why so many Facebook users leave their privacy settings
bodyText ||| relatively open [13]. If ‘social searching’ is a public good,
bodyText ||| then reciprocity rules would dictate that by enabling a
bodyText ||| degree of surveillance of oneself, one would should also be
bodyText ||| able to engage in reciprocal surveillance of others. For
bodyText ||| instance, Gross and Acquisti [13] report that only 1.2% of
bodyText ||| users changed the default ‘search’ privacy setting, and less
bodyText ||| than 1/2% of users changed the default ‘profile visibility’
bodyText ||| privacy settings.
bodyText ||| Enabling Facebook users who are not currently linked as
bodyText ||| friends to view personal aspects of one’s profile may also
bodyText ||| be a strategy to increase the size of one’s social network. In
bodyText ||| support of this view, [17] report that users completion of
bodyText ||| profile fields that share a common referent (e.g. class,
bodyText ||| hometown) is positively associated with more friends,
bodyText ||| perhaps because such information encourages the
bodyText ||| development of ties based on shared experiences. Profile
bodyText ||| elements that focused on individual likes and dislikes did
bodyText ||| not have an association with the number of friends.
bodyText ||| As noted earlier, Facebook.com has undergone radical
bodyText ||| change over the last twelve months. By moving outside of
bodyText ||| the US-academic environment and embracing users
bodyText ||| globally and outside of academia, it has not only changed
bodyText ||| the profile of its users, but also the potential motivations for
bodyText ||| their use. While tightly controlled, geographically bounded
bodyText ||| networks based on university affiliation still exist, they are
bodyText ||| dwarfed by networks based outside of academia – for
bodyText ||| instance, as of September 2007, the ‘London’ network has
bodyText ||| over 1 million members, New York over 355,000 and
bodyText ||| Toronto over 800,000. The present paper examines the
bodyText ||| motivations of Facebook users using a ‘uses and
bodyText ||| gratifications’ framework.
bodyText ||| Uses and gratifications refer to the ‘how and why’ of media
bodyText ||| use [23]. Specifically, ‘uses and gratifications’ refer to the
bodyText ||| motivations of specific uses, and the satisfaction people
bodyText ||| gain from such use. These gratifications can be divided into
bodyText ||| those based on the content of the media (content
bodyText ||| gratifications) and those based on the actual experience of
bodyText ||| using the media (process gratifications). Typically, content
bodyText ||| gratifications are held to be related to the repeated use of a
bodyText ||| media [18] which for the designers of such systems relates
bodyText ||| to a site’s ‘stickiness’. However, the Internet, and social
bodyText ||| networking sites in particular, also provide communication
bodyText ||| and interaction, unlike many ‘old media’ (e.g. television).
bodyText ||| This led Stafford et al. [23] to propose a third form of
bodyText ||| gratification arising from Internet use: as a social
bodyText ||| environment.
bodyText ||| In the present study, the usual two stage approach to
bodyText ||| studying uses and gratification is adopted [3]. In Study 1,
bodyText ||| Facebook users are asked to generate lists of words or
bodyText ||| phrases that describe their uses and gratifications in an
bodyText ||| exploratory way. In Study 2, these terms are subjected to
bodyText ||| factor analysis in order to form grouped profiles of specific
bodyText ||| uses and gratifications.
sectionHeader ||| STUDY 1: EXPLORATORY STAGE
subsectionHeader ||| Participants
bodyText ||| Participants were 137 Facebook users who responded to a
bodyText ||| request to complete a short online study. The sample
bodyText ||| comprised 53 males and 88 females (Mean age = 26.3
bodyText ||| years). Participants were recruited through a number of
bodyText ||| different methods: postings to the ‘wall’ of three network
bodyText ||| homepages on Facebook (two universities, one regional), a
bodyText ||| paid flyer shown 10,000 times across all networks, and
bodyText ||| links on academic survey websites. The survey was open
bodyText ||| during the first two weeks of July 2007.
subsectionHeader ||| Materials
bodyText ||| The online survey comprised a series of basic demographic
bodyText ||| questions (e.g. age, gender, occupation, location), alongside
bodyText ||| some measures of use of Facebook (time spent on site each
bodyText ||| week, number of friends linked on site, history of use).
page ||| 1028
note ||| CHI 2008 Proceedings · Online Social Networks	April 5-10, 2008 · Florence, Italy
bodyText ||| Following this, participants were asked to respond to the
bodyText ||| following questions adapted from [23] using free text entry:
listItem ||| •	What is the first thing that comes to mind when
listItem ||| you think about what you enjoy most when using
listItem ||| Facebook?
listItem ||| •	What other words describe what you enjoy about
listItem ||| using Facebook?
listItem ||| •	Using single, easy-to-understand terms, what do
listItem ||| you use Facebook for?
listItem ||| •	What uses of Facebook are most important to you?
subsectionHeader ||| Results
bodyText ||| Two raters clustered the descriptive items and phrases
bodyText ||| developed by Facebook users in response to the first
bodyText ||| question. The raters worked collaboratively to develop the
bodyText ||| clusters, and were instructed to ‘identify responses that are
bodyText ||| related’. The author then discussed the themes with the
bodyText ||| raters, and named them accordingly. The main themes
bodyText ||| identified are outlined in Table 1.

tableCaption ||| Table 1: Frequency of mentions (Question 1)
bodyText ||| In keeping with previous research [e.g. 16], the use of
bodyText ||| Facebook to ‘keep in touch’ received the largest number of
bodyText ||| mentions, with the use of the site to make new contacts
bodyText ||| receiving a small number of mentions.
sectionHeader ||| STUDY 2: IDENTIFYING USES AND GRATIFICATIONS
subsectionHeader ||| Item generation
bodyText ||| A sample of items from each use and gratification proposed
bodyText ||| by users was extracted from the exploratory list developed
bodyText ||| in Study 1. Participants’ responses to items 2–4 were
bodyText ||| examined, and any occurrences of other uses or
bodyText ||| gratifications not mentioned in response to the first item
bodyText ||| were added to the list. This led to a total of 46 items. Where
bodyText ||| possible, the item was taken word for word from participant
bodyText ||| responses to Study 1.
subsectionHeader ||| Participants
bodyText ||| Participants were 241 Facebook users recruited using the
bodyText ||| same methods outlined in Study 1. In addition, e-mails were
bodyText ||| sent to selected mailing lists with a request for participation
bodyText ||| (e.g. AIR-L). Participants were 80 males (33.2%) and 161
bodyText ||| (66.8%) females (mean age = 25.97 years (SD = 9.30, range
bodyText ||| 15-66 years old). The majority of the sample were full time
bodyText ||| students (n = 151, 62.7%), 6.6% (n = 16) were part-time
bodyText ||| students and worked part- or full-time (or had carer
bodyText ||| responsibilities), and 30.7% were in full-time work and not
bodyText ||| studying (n = 78). The study was open during the final
bodyText ||| week in July, and throughout August.
subsectionHeader ||| Measures
bodyText ||| The same demographic and Facebook use measures
bodyText ||| described in Study 1 were used in Study 2. Participants also
bodyText ||| completed an item related to their use of Facebook privacy
bodyText ||| settings, specifically if they had changed the default
bodyText ||| settings, and if so, the degree to which they had made them
bodyText ||| more private or more open.
bodyText ||| Participants were finally asked to rate, using a 7-point
bodyText ||| Likert scale, the 46 uses and gratifications derived from
bodyText ||| Study 1 using the metric, “How important are the following
bodyText ||| uses of Facebook to you personally?’ The scale was
bodyText ||| anchored at 1 (very unimportant) and 7 (very important).
subsectionHeader ||| Results
bodyText ||| Participants had an average of 124 friends linked to their
bodyText ||| Facebook profile (Range 1-1000, Median = 85, SD =
bodyText ||| 129.97). Around half of the participants had been registered
bodyText ||| on the site for less than six months (6.3% for less than one
bodyText ||| month, 9.6% for between one and two months and 29.2%
bodyText ||| for between two and six months). The remaining
bodyText ||| participants had been signed up for between six months and
bodyText ||| a year (21.7%), more than one year, but less than two
bodyText ||| (21.7%) or for more than two years (10.8%). The majority
bodyText ||| of participants visited the site either daily (38.8%) or more
bodyText ||| than once a day (27.5%). Almost a quarter visited Facebook
bodyText ||| several times a week (22.5%), with 6.7% visiting once a
bodyText ||| week on average, and 4.2% visiting less than once a week.
page ||| 1029
note ||| CHI 2008 Proceedings · Online Social Networks	April 5-10, 2008 · Florence, Italy
bodyText ||| Amongst all respondents, the most common responses for
bodyText ||| the time spent on the site each week were between 1 and 2
bodyText ||| hours (33.3%) and between 2 and 5 hours (32.5%). A
bodyText ||| relatively small proportion of users claimed to spend either
bodyText ||| less than 1 hour a week (16.9%) or between 5 and 10 hours
bodyText ||| (11.0%) on the site. The proportion of users claiming more
bodyText ||| than 10 hours Facebook use per week was small (5.4%).
bodyText ||| Unlike previous research [13], the majority of users claimed
bodyText ||| to have changed the default privacy settings in Facebook,
bodyText ||| with 25.6% (n = 61) reporting making their profile
bodyText ||| ‘somewhat’ more private, 21% (n = 50) ‘much more’
bodyText ||| private and 10.9% (n = 26) making it ‘as private as
bodyText ||| possible. A smaller group claimed to have made their
bodyText ||| profile either more ‘open’ (9.2%, n = 22) or ‘as open to
bodyText ||| others as possible (9.2%, n = 22). The number of people
bodyText ||| making no changes to their profile (23.5%, n = 56) was
bodyText ||| substantially lower than that reported in previous studies
bodyText ||| [ 14].
bodyText ||| The most important uses of Facebook tended to be related
bodyText ||| to the ‘social searching’ and surveillance functions (see
bodyText ||| Tables 2-8), identified by [16]. Specifically, the use of the
bodyText ||| site to learn about old friends and maintain or re-connect
bodyText ||| relations scored consistently highly. This pattern repeats
bodyText ||| previous findings from student samples [7, 16].
bodyText ||| To investigate the nature of the various uses and
bodyText ||| gratifications of Facebook in more depth, exploratory factor
bodyText ||| analysis was conducted. The initial factor analysis (varimax
bodyText ||| rotation) yielded 9 components with eigenvalues over 1,
bodyText ||| explaining 64.8% of the variance. Examination of the scree
bodyText ||| plot and unique loadings suggested that seven components
bodyText ||| (explaining 59% of the variance) should be retained for
bodyText ||| further analysis. Only four items did not load on any of the
bodyText ||| factors: one was related to privacy settings, two about use
bodyText ||| of the ‘poke’ facility and one about leaving messages on the
bodyText ||| ‘wall’.
sectionHeader ||| INTERPRETATION OF FACTORS AND SCALE
sectionHeader ||| DEVELOPMENT
bodyText ||| To aid further analysis, scales were developed from each
bodyText ||| factor. As a preliminary check, score distributions on each
bodyText ||| item were examined to ensure that none suffered from
bodyText ||| restricted range (i.e., the full range of response options was
bodyText ||| being used). This was the case for all items. Items were
bodyText ||| identified as markers of each factor based on the commonly
bodyText ||| used benchmark of a loading greater than .5. Items that had
bodyText ||| significant loadings on other factors were discounted as
bodyText ||| marker items [22].
bodyText ||| Application of these criteria led to identification of eight
bodyText ||| marker items for Factor 1, three for Factors 2, four for
bodyText ||| Factor 3, four each for Factor 4 and 5, and three each for
bodyText ||| Factor 6 and 7.
bodyText ||| Factor 1 (Table 2) contains items predominantly concerned
bodyText ||| with ‘keeping in touch’ (the most often mentioned use of
bodyText ||| Facebook in Study 1, and by [16]). The items have a clear
bodyText ||| focus on re-connecting with lost contacts and maintaining
bodyText ||| contact with existing friends. Some of the items loading on
bodyText ||| this factor also clearly relate to the ‘surveillance’ function
bodyText ||| identified by [16], for instance, ‘Finding out what old
bodyText ||| friends are doing now”. Others are more closely related to
bodyText ||| the creation or maintenance of ‘weak ties’ (e.g.
bodyText ||| “Maintaining relationships with people you may not get to
bodyText ||| see very often”). Because of the combination of
bodyText ||| surveillance and social capital functions, this factor and
bodyText ||| related scale is labeled ‘social connection’. Two items
bodyText ||| loaded on this factor, but did not meet the criteria for factor
bodyText ||| purity: ‘Reading messages on your wall’ and ‘Seeing how
bodyText ||| old acquaintances look’).
table ||| Factor 1: Social connection (Cronbach’s Alpha = .89)	Item Mean (SD)	Loading
table ||| Finding out what old friends are doing now	5.08 (1.71)	.753
table ||| Reconnecting with people you’ve lost contact with	5.29 (1.79)	.783
table ||| Connecting with people you otherwise would have lost contact with	5.53 (1.61)	.842
table ||| Receiving a friend request	4.86 (1.68)	.601
table ||| Finding people you haven’t seen for a while	5.41 (1.66)	.850
table ||| Maintaining relationships with people you may not get to see very often	5.71 (1.56)	.764
table ||| Contacting friends who are away from home	5.46 (1.83)	.522
tableCaption ||| Table 2: Items and loading (Factor 1)
bodyText ||| The second factor is comprised of three items related to the
bodyText ||| joining of groups, organization of events and meeting of
bodyText ||| ‘like-minded people’ (see Table 3). These activities are akin
bodyText ||| to ‘social browsing’ identified by Lampe et al.; although
bodyText ||| there is no reason to assume that they are necessarily
bodyText ||| motivated by a desire to meet offline eventually. It also
bodyText ||| contains related to the discovery of new music and new
bodyText ||| groups via friends. As such, it seems to represent a ‘shared
bodyText ||| identities’ function. Two items (‘Seeing what kinds of
bodyText ||| networks and special interest groups your friends have’ and
bodyText ||| ‘Learning about new music’) loaded on the factor, but did
bodyText ||| not meet the factor purity criteria.
table ||| Factor 2: Shared identities (Cronbach’s alpha .74)	Item Mean (SD)	Loading
table ||| Organizing or joining events	3.42 (1.82)	.699
table ||| Joining groups	3.52 (1.63)	.727
table ||| Communication with likeminded people	3.82 (1.76)	.638
tableCaption ||| Table 3: Items and loading (Factor 2)
page ||| 1030
note ||| CHI 2008 Proceedings · Online Social Networks	April 5-10, 2008 · Florence, Italy
bodyText ||| The third factor is related to the posting and viewing of
bodyText ||| photographs (see Table 4), although many of the items also
bodyText ||| had loadings in the .3 region on the first factor. This
bodyText ||| suggests that these activities within Facebook may fulfill a
bodyText ||| number of gratifications. Specifically, the social uses of
bodyText ||| photographs (e.g. sharing, tagging) may also play an
bodyText ||| important role in ‘social connection’. However, by forming
bodyText ||| a unique factor, they may also be a content gratification in
bodyText ||| their own right.
table ||| Factor 3: Photographs (Cronbach’s alpha =.89)	Item Mean (SD)	Loading
table ||| Viewing photos	5.03 (1.72)	.609
table ||| Being tagged in photos	4.24 (1.90)	.668
table ||| Tagging photos	3.96 (1.89)	.734
table ||| Sharing / posting photographs	4.58 (1.89)	.701
tableCaption ||| Table 4: Items and loading (Factor 3)
bodyText ||| Factor four contains items related to content within
bodyText ||| Facebook – for instance, applications and quizzes (see
bodyText ||| Table 5). This relates to the usual ‘content gratification’
bodyText ||| identified in previous media research. It is worthwhile
bodyText ||| noting that while these items form a unique factor, the mean
bodyText ||| scores are relatively low. A single item (‘Looking at posted
bodyText ||| items’) loaded on the factor, but did not meet factor purity
bodyText ||| criteria.
table ||| Factor 4: Content (Cronbach’s alpha = .74)	Item Mean (SD)	Loading
table ||| Applications within Facebook	2.85 (1.65)	.826
table ||| Playing games	1.86 (1.40)	.559
table ||| Discovering apps because you see friends have added them	2.64 (1.58)	.756
table ||| Quizzes	1.85 1.30)	.638
tableCaption ||| Table 5: Items and loading (Factor 4)
bodyText ||| Factor five contains items akin to both social searching and
bodyText ||| social browsing identified by Lampe et al [16]. The items
bodyText ||| comprising this factor cover both the use of Facebook to
bodyText ||| meet or view new people and to find out more about people
bodyText ||| who are met offline (see Table 6).
table ||| Factor 5: Social investigation (Cronbach’s alpha =.75)	Item Mean (SD)	Loading
table ||| Virtual people watching	3.31 (1.90)	.574
table ||| Using advanced search to look for specific types of people	2.56 (1.70)	.508
table ||| Meeting new people	2.91 (1.83)	.509
table ||| Stalking other people	2.13 (1.71)	.755
tableCaption ||| Table 6: Items and loading (Factor 5)
bodyText ||| One item (‘Looking up the profile of people you meet
bodyText ||| offline’) loaded on the factor but did not meet the purity
bodyText ||| criteria. The items do share a targeted investigation of
bodyText ||| others, however. As such, the factor is termed ‘social
bodyText ||| investigation’.
bodyText ||| Factor six comprises items related to a unique affordance of
bodyText ||| social networking sites – the ability to view other people’s
bodyText ||| social networks and friends (see Table 7). This ability to
bodyText ||| find out more about one’s acquaintances through their
bodyText ||| social networks forms another important surveillance
bodyText ||| function, and may also be a method for increasing the size
bodyText ||| of one’s own social network. This specific use is termed
bodyText ||| ‘Social network surfing’ here to signify the ability of users
bodyText ||| to move from one person to another via friend links,
bodyText ||| although it may also relate closely to a ‘process
bodyText ||| gratification’.
table ||| Factor 6: Social network surfing (Cronbach’s alpha =.79)	Item Mean (SD)	Loading
table ||| Looking at the profiles of people you don’t know	2.48 (1.53)	.719
table ||| Viewing other people’s friends	3.34 (1.74)	.785
table ||| Browsing your friends’ friends	3.89 (1.65)	.724
tableCaption ||| Table 7: Items and loading (Factor 6)
bodyText ||| The final factor comprises items related to the newsfeed
bodyText ||| and status updates within Facebook. The newsfeed provides
bodyText ||| updates on both ‘friends’ status, alongside recent activity
bodyText ||| (e.g. the addition or removal of applications, changes in
bodyText ||| relationship status, addition of ‘friends’). Given the outcry
bodyText ||| when the newsfeed was introduced [2], the relative high
bodyText ||| scores for this use suggest an increasing degree of
bodyText ||| acceptance. Interestingly, a gratification (‘to keep up with
bodyText ||| the latest gossip’) also loaded on this factor (although only
bodyText ||| at the .4 level), suggesting a clear motivation for viewing
bodyText ||| the newsfeed.

subsectionHeader ||| User demographics and uses and gratifications
bodyText ||| A MANOVA test found a significant difference between
bodyText ||| males and females on their scores across the seven uses and
bodyText ||| gratifications scales (F (7, 233) = 2.662, p < 0.02). Further
bodyText ||| analysis of the between-subjects effects on the dependent
bodyText ||| variables showed that scores were significantly different on
bodyText ||| the first factor – ‘social connection’ (F (1, 239) = 16.16,
bodyText ||| p<0.001, η2= .063), with females scoring higher on the
bodyText ||| scale (M = 5.40, SD = 1.22) compared to males (M = 4.70,
bodyText ||| SD = 1.37), on the third factor - ‘photographs’ (F (1, 239) =
bodyText ||| 8.95, p<0.01, 112= .036), with females again scoring higher
bodyText ||| on the scale (M = 4.67, SD = 1.61) compared to males (M =
bodyText ||| 4.02, SD = 1.51). There was a marginally significant
bodyText ||| difference across the seventh factor – ‘status updates’ (F (1,
bodyText ||| 239) = 3.26, p=.072, r)2= .0 13), with females scoring higher
bodyText ||| on the scale (M = 3.94, SD = 1.40) compared to males (M =
bodyText ||| 3.58, SD = 1.47).
bodyText ||| A one-way between subjects ANOVA found a significant
bodyText ||| effect of gender on profile privacy settings (F (1, 236) =
bodyText ||| 12.29, p < .01), with females more likely to report making
bodyText ||| their profile more private (Mean = 4.83, SD = 1.60)
bodyText ||| compared to males (Mean = 4.01, SD = 1.86)
bodyText ||| A further MANOVA test was conducted to compare
bodyText ||| responses to the items in light of occupational status (i.e.
bodyText ||| full-time student, full-time employed, part-time
bodyText ||| student/employed). Given the relatively low number of
bodyText ||| people working part-time / studying part-time, this group
bodyText ||| was excluded from the analysis. The results showed a
bodyText ||| significant overall effect of occupational status on uses and
bodyText ||| gratifications of Facebook (F (7, 217) = 4.93, p < .001),
bodyText ||| with significant effects for Factor 1 (social connection – F
bodyText ||| (1, 223) = 7.3 1, p<.01), Factor 2 (shared identities – F (1,
bodyText ||| 223) = 4.90, p<.05), and Factor 3 (photographs – F (1, 223)
bodyText ||| = 7.85, p< .01).
bodyText ||| Full-time students scored higher on social connection and
bodyText ||| photographs, and lower on shared identities, compared to
bodyText ||| those in full-time work (Factor 1 Mean = 5.38 (SD = 1.16)
bodyText ||| for students, Mean = 4.89 (SD = 1.45) for full-time
bodyText ||| employment; Factor 2 Mean = 3.47 (SD = 1.37) for
bodyText ||| students, Mean = 3.90 (SD = 1.40) for full-time
bodyText ||| employment; Factor 3 Mean = 4.71 (SD = 1.53) for
bodyText ||| students, Mean = 4.09 (SD = 1.57) for full-time
bodyText ||| employment).
bodyText ||| Age also correlated negatively with their scores on social
bodyText ||| connection (rs(225) = -.27, p<.001), and photographs (rs(225) =
bodyText ||| -.32, p<.001), with younger respondents scoring higher on
bodyText ||| both scales. Age did not correlate with the other factor-
bodyText ||| derived scales.
bodyText ||| Age also correlated with the length of time users had been
bodyText ||| registered on Facebook (rs(241) = -.17, p<0.01), the regularity
bodyText ||| with which they visited the site (rs(241) = -.18, p<.01), the
bodyText ||| number of hours they used the site in a week (rs(241) = -.22,
bodyText ||| p<.01) and the number of friends they had linked to their
bodyText ||| profile (rs(219) = -.37, p<.001). In all cases, a younger user
bodyText ||| was associated with higher usage levels, and a greater
bodyText ||| number of ‘friends’.
bodyText ||| Age was also negatively correlated with the use of privacy
bodyText ||| settings (rs(238) = -.17, p<.01), such that younger users report
bodyText ||| that they were more likely to have increased the privacy of
bodyText ||| their profile. In part this may be due to the higher number
bodyText ||| of friends amongst younger users.
subsectionHeader ||| Predicting Facebook use
bodyText ||| A number of earlier researchers have predicted that certain
bodyText ||| uses and gratifications of Facebook may be associated with
bodyText ||| greater use of the site. For instance, [17] note that
bodyText ||| completion of certain profile elements is associated with a
bodyText ||| greater number of ‘friends’, while the findings of [16])
bodyText ||| suggest that the use of Facebook for social searching and
bodyText ||| surveillance motivates use.
bodyText ||| To examine possible motivators for use of Facebook, a
bodyText ||| series of multiple regression equations were calculated
bodyText ||| using scores on the seven factor-based scales to predict both
bodyText ||| the frequency of visits to the site and the time spent on
bodyText ||| Facebook during an average week. Age, occupation and
bodyText ||| gender were also entered as covariates (part-time excluded).
bodyText ||| The results of the regression analyses to predict the
bodyText ||| frequency of site use are shown in Table 10. The overall
bodyText ||| model was significant (F (10, 213) = 4.77, p<0.001, R2 =
bodyText ||| .15).
bodyText ||| A second regression equation examined the same variables
bodyText ||| predicting the amount of time spent on the site (see Table
page ||| 1032
note ||| CHI 2008 Proceedings · Online Social Networks	April 5-10, 2008 · Florence, Italy
bodyText ||| 11). Again, the overall model was significant (F (10, 210) =
bodyText ||| 3.85, p<0.001, R2 = .12).

table ||| F7 – ‘status updates’	-.296	-3.848	.000
tableCaption ||| Table 10: Predicting frequency of visits to Facebook
bodyText ||| The regression equations show a differential pattern of uses
bodyText ||| and gratifications motivating frequency of visits to the site,
bodyText ||| and the time spent on the site. Gender (females visit more
bodyText ||| frequently) and scores on the ‘photographs’ and ‘status
bodyText ||| updates’ factors predict the frequency of visits to the site.
bodyText ||| Higher scores on both scales predicted more frequent visits.
bodyText ||| There was a marginally significant effect of ‘social
bodyText ||| investigation’ (higher scores related to less frequent visits).
bodyText ||| However, participants age (younger spend more time) and
bodyText ||| scores on the content gratification scale predict the actual
bodyText ||| number of hours spent online. This suggests that
bodyText ||| surveillance gratifications motivate repeat visits, but that
bodyText ||| content gratifications motivate people to spend longer on
bodyText ||| the site when they do visit.

table ||| F7 – ‘status updates’	.086	1.092	.276
tableCaption ||| Table 11: Predicting time spent (hours) on Facebook
bodyText ||| A final regression equation was calculated to predict the
bodyText ||| number of ‘friends’ users reported on Facebook (see Table
bodyText ||| 12). Given that the number of friends should be related to
bodyText ||| the length of time users had been registered on Facebook,
bodyText ||| and the intensity of their use, the usage measures (length of
bodyText ||| time, frequency of visit, time spent on site) were entered
bodyText ||| alongside the remaining variables.
bodyText ||| The overall model was significant (F (15, 196) = 8.48, p <
bodyText ||| .001, R2 = .31).
bodyText ||| As might be expected, age was associated with the number
bodyText ||| of ‘friends’ (younger have more ‘friends’), as was the
bodyText ||| amount of time users had been registered on the site and the
bodyText ||| frequency of their site visits (longer time registered, and
bodyText ||| more frequent visits, associated with more friends).
bodyText ||| Interestingly, scores on the ‘social connection’ scale were
bodyText ||| not associated with ‘friend’ numbers, while scores on the
bodyText ||| ‘content gratification’ scale were negatively associated with
bodyText ||| the number of ‘friends’ (i.e. higher scores associated with
bodyText ||| smaller number of ‘friends’). Scores on the ‘social
bodyText ||| investigation’ scale were positively associated with the
bodyText ||| number of friends, while scores on the ‘photographs’ scale
bodyText ||| were marginally significantly associated with an increased
bodyText ||| number of friends.

subsectionHeader ||| Use of Facebook Privacy Settings and meeting new
subsectionHeader ||| people
bodyText ||| A final set of analyses were conducted to examine the
bodyText ||| relationship between specific uses and respondents’
bodyText ||| reported privacy profile settings. The privacy settings of
bodyText ||| users were grouped, according to their responses, into those
bodyText ||| who reported making their profile less private (n=44), those
page ||| 1033
note ||| CHI 2008 Proceedings · Online Social Networks	April 5-10, 2008 · Florence, Italy
bodyText ||| who reported leaving it at the default setting (n = 56), and
bodyText ||| those who reported making it more private (n = 137). In the
bodyText ||| main, privacy settings in Facebook allow users to hide their
bodyText ||| profile from people who are neither listed as ‘friends’ or
bodyText ||| members of the user’s own network. However, if the
bodyText ||| motive for using Facebook is to meet new people, then such
bodyText ||| privacy settings would be somewhat counter productive. To
bodyText ||| test this proposition, a MANOVA was conducted with
bodyText ||| privacy settings as the independent variable, and the
bodyText ||| responses to items related to meeting new people set as the
bodyText ||| dependent variables. The results showed a significant link
bodyText ||| between privacy settings and the responses to the items (F
bodyText ||| (8, 454) = 2.11, p < .05). Analysis of the between subjects
bodyText ||| effects found no difference in responses to the ‘joining
bodyText ||| groups’ or ‘joining events’ items and privacy settings (ps >
bodyText ||| .3), but a significant effect of reported privacy settings on
bodyText ||| responses to the item ‘meeting new people’ (F (2, 229) =
bodyText ||| 4.16, p < .02), and a marginally significant effect on the
bodyText ||| item ‘using advanced search to look for specific types of
bodyText ||| people’ (F (2, 229) = 2.48, p = .08). The means for the
bodyText ||| ‘meeting new people’ item across the three privacy groups
bodyText ||| are shown in Figure 1.
figureCaption ||| Figure 1: Scores on ‘meeting new people’ by privacy
figureCaption ||| settings
bodyText ||| These results suggest that for users wishing to use
bodyText ||| Facebook to meet new people, the privacy settings may be
bodyText ||| set at too stringent a level. Further analyses confirmed no
bodyText ||| links between the social connection scales and privacy
bodyText ||| settings, suggesting that a primary motivation for making
bodyText ||| one’s profile less private is the desire to meet new people.
sectionHeader ||| DISCUSSION
bodyText ||| Social networking sites pose a number of challenges for
bodyText ||| HCI researchers and practitioners. First, the actual uses and
bodyText ||| gratifications of such sites are not well understood. The
bodyText ||| present paper presents the first study of a social networking
bodyText ||| site using a ‘uses and gratifications’ framework, and also
bodyText ||| provides an empirically developed measurement tool for
bodyText ||| future research.
bodyText ||| Second, previous research that has been conducted has
bodyText ||| tended to focus on campus-based use of Facebook [e.g. 7,
bodyText ||| 13, 6, 11, 17], which may limit the generalizability of any
bodyText ||| findings. However, the results of the present research
bodyText ||| support many of the conclusions of earlier research
bodyText ||| conducted on student populations. For instance, the
bodyText ||| distinction previously drawn between ‘social searching’ and
bodyText ||| ‘social browsing’ uses of Facebook [16] was similarly
bodyText ||| evident in the present research. Moreover, in keeping with
bodyText ||| prior student-users research [e.g. 7, 16], the use of
bodyText ||| Facebook to ‘keep in touch’ was the most commonly
bodyText ||| mentioned term in Study 1, and formed a large proportion
bodyText ||| of the items comprising the first factor in Study 2.
bodyText ||| However, the adoption of a uses and gratifications approach
bodyText ||| enables us to begin to probe in more depth the exact nature
bodyText ||| of ‘keeping in touch’ as both a use and a gratification. The
bodyText ||| results of the present study suggest that ‘keeping in touch’
bodyText ||| comprises two main functions. The first is a surveillance
bodyText ||| function as identified by Lampe and colleagues [16].
bodyText ||| Facebook is used to see what old contacts and friends are
bodyText ||| ‘up to’, how they look and how they behave. In keeping
bodyText ||| with this use, there is evidence that Facebook profiles serve
bodyText ||| an important self-presentation tool [26]. Associated with
bodyText ||| this use is the social capital building gratification, where
bodyText ||| Facebook is used to build, invest in and maintain ties with
bodyText ||| distant friends and contacts [7, 11].
bodyText ||| The ‘social search’ and ‘social browsing’ uses of Facebook
bodyText ||| identified by Lampe and colleagues [16] were closely
bodyText ||| related in the present study. The use of Facebook to search
bodyText ||| for new people loaded on the same factor as the use of
bodyText ||| Facebook to research offline contacts. This ‘virtual people
bodyText ||| watching’ was represented in both Factors 5 and 6, with the
bodyText ||| important distinction that Factor 6 relied primarily on
bodyText ||| ‘friend of friend’ connections, while Factor 5 represented
bodyText ||| targeted investigation of people met offline, or searched for.
bodyText ||| Symptomatic of this distinction is the difference between
bodyText ||| ‘looking up’ (Factor 5) and ‘looking at’ (Factor 6) people.
bodyText ||| In the present study, only social investigation was
bodyText ||| associated with a higher number of ‘friends’, not social
bodyText ||| network browsing.
bodyText ||| Interestingly, an increased score on the content gratification
bodyText ||| scale was negatively related to the number of ‘friends’
bodyText ||| reported to be linked to one’s profile. This perhaps suggests
bodyText ||| a sub-set of users gain gratification through the use of
bodyText ||| applications within Facebook, rather than through the
bodyText ||| accrual of ‘friends’. However, many of the applications
bodyText ||| available in Facebook are social in nature (e.g. scrabble
bodyText ||| games, ways to rate friends). But, at present these
bodyText ||| applications tend to rely on existing contacts, rather than the
bodyText ||| accrual of new ‘friends’. As such, they may serve to
bodyText ||| strengthen social ties, rather than acting to increase the
bodyText ||| overall size of a social network. Thus, investment of time
bodyText ||| and effort in social applications within Facebook may be
bodyText ||| akin to messaging between friends [11] – it solidifies ties,
bodyText ||| rather than creating new links.
bodyText ||| Users responses on the scales created from the factors also
bodyText ||| predicted their pattern of use of the site. In keeping with

note ||| CHI 2008 Proceedings · Online Social Networks	April 5-10, 2008 · Florence, Italy
bodyText ||| earlier work on traditional media, content gratification
bodyText ||| predicted the amount of time spent on the site. However,
bodyText ||| the use of the site for social investigation, viewing and
bodyText ||| posting photographs and viewing status updates predicted
bodyText ||| the frequency of visits. It would seem from the present data
bodyText ||| that ‘keeping in touch’ may in actuality refer to ‘checking
bodyText ||| up on regularly’, while the ‘stickiness’ of the site (in terms
bodyText ||| of time spent on it) depends on use of the content and
bodyText ||| applications. This insight is clearly important for designers
bodyText ||| of social networking sites and associated content. If repeat
bodyText ||| visits are motivated by different uses and gratifications than
bodyText ||| the amount of time spent on the site, it is important to
bodyText ||| design content gratification alongside the ability to build
bodyText ||| and maintain social connections. It also suggests that the
bodyText ||| furor caused by the introduction of the newsfeed [2] has
bodyText ||| subsided, and been replaced by its new role as a ‘killer
bodyText ||| app’, at least in terms of repeat visits to the site. In many
bodyText ||| ways, this use of Facebook reflects the desire for ‘perpetual
bodyText ||| contact’ [15], and previously supplied by standalone
bodyText ||| services like Twitter [24]. While the social implications of
bodyText ||| this interest in perpetual contact and updates on ‘friends’
bodyText ||| are beyond the remit of the present paper, it is worth noting
bodyText ||| that an increased awareness of others’ actions has
bodyText ||| potentially important implications for how we relate to
bodyText ||| others, and understand ourselves.
subsectionHeader ||| Design Implications
bodyText ||| The designers of social networking sites should consider the
bodyText ||| varied uses and gratifications reported by users, and need to
bodyText ||| recognize that not all users have the same uses of a social
bodyText ||| networking site, nor derive the same gratifications from
bodyText ||| their use. For instance, there are clear distinctions between
bodyText ||| the use of Facebook to maintain and re-create connections
bodyText ||| with friends, its use as a surveillance tool and for content
bodyText ||| delivery. There were also differences in reported uses by
bodyText ||| age, gender and occupational status. It may be that different
bodyText ||| demographic groups are motivated to use social networking
bodyText ||| sites for different purposes, with social connectivity and
bodyText ||| perpetual contact motivating younger (and female) users
bodyText ||| more than older (and male) users.
bodyText ||| The differing goals for the use of Facebook are reflected not
bodyText ||| only in usage patterns, but also in users’ privacy settings.
bodyText ||| People who have made their privacy settings more
bodyText ||| permissive are more likely to want to meet new people
bodyText ||| (they also score higher on the content gratifications scale).
bodyText ||| This is a designed aspect of the system – in both cases, to
bodyText ||| fulfill one’s goal often requires a more permissive approach
bodyText ||| to profile privacy. Many of the applications are social in
bodyText ||| nature (e.g. comparing oneself with others, asking questions
bodyText ||| to ‘friends’, viewing people from one’s neighborhood), and
bodyText ||| often circumvent elements of the default privacy settings.
bodyText ||| Similarly, if the goal is to meet new people, making one’s
bodyText ||| profile more open than by default allows others pursuing
bodyText ||| the same gratification to view your profile, and presumably
bodyText ||| increases the chances of an interaction. For these users, the
bodyText ||| profile within Facebook is likely to become a key self-
bodyText ||| presentation tool, rather than simply a way to ‘keep in
bodyText ||| touch’ with others [6, 26].
subsectionHeader ||| Limitations and Further research
bodyText ||| The present research is a ‘snap shot’ of Facebook users, and
bodyText ||| further work should consider the possibility of researching
bodyText ||| the development of use over time. In particular, it would be
bodyText ||| of interest to see how people’s uses and gratifications of
bodyText ||| Facebook develop, and if the frequency of visit is motivated
bodyText ||| by ‘perpetual contact’ over time. There is, for instance,
bodyText ||| considerable research in the field of habit formation that
bodyText ||| could inform the study of social network site use. HCI
bodyText ||| research should also consider ways in which the desire to
bodyText ||| meet new people, and to allow oneself to be viewed by
bodyText ||| strangers, can be accommodated in a privacy-protecting
bodyText ||| manner [14]. At present, Facebook has reasonably nuanced
bodyText ||| privacy controls. From the results of the present research, it
bodyText ||| would seem that users are changing the default privacy
bodyText ||| settings in a motivated manner. However, the present study
bodyText ||| only collected reported privacy settings. It would be
bodyText ||| prudent to complete research that actually examined
bodyText ||| settings via automated querying of the site [e.g. 13], or by
bodyText ||| studying a corpus of actual interactions [e.g. 11].
bodyText ||| It should also be noted that the nature of the sampling
bodyText ||| method, and the self-selection of respondents, may have
bodyText ||| influenced the pattern of responses and overall levels of
bodyText ||| activity. Future research may wish to study a wider group
bodyText ||| of participants, or attempt to identify patterns of usage
bodyText ||| amongst non-respondents compared to respondents
sectionHeader ||| CONCLUSIONS
bodyText ||| Users derive a variety of uses and gratifications from social
bodyText ||| networking sites, including traditional content gratification
bodyText ||| alongside building social capital, communication,
bodyText ||| surveillance and social networking surfing. The different
bodyText ||| uses and gratifications relate differentially to patterns of
bodyText ||| usage, with social connection gratifications tending to lead
bodyText ||| to increased frequency of use, and content gratifications to
bodyText ||| increased time spent on the site. The variety of uses to
bodyText ||| which Facebook is put by its users identifies particular
bodyText ||| challenges for the designers of such sites. For instance, a
bodyText ||| default privacy setting may be too restrictive for users
bodyText ||| seeking to meet new people, or who wish to allow new
bodyText ||| people to discover them.
bodyText ||| Since user’s desire to engage in surveillance of their peers
bodyText ||| also motivates the frequency of site visit, this also poses a
bodyText ||| unique challenge in balancing user’s privacy concerns and
bodyText ||| controls with a key raison d’être of social networking sites
bodyText ||| like Facebook. At present, Facebook allows users to
bodyText ||| manage their ‘feed’, removing ‘stories’ as they wish. This
bodyText ||| solution not only provides a degree of privacy control to
bodyText ||| users, but it also enables users to engage with the site as a
bodyText ||| self-presentation tool [26] at numerous levels – not only via
bodyText ||| their profile and network, but also through their activity
bodyText ||| (and the removal of specific ‘stories’). As perpetual contact
bodyText ||| continues to develop, designers will need to face the
page ||| 1035
note ||| CHI 2008 Proceedings · Online Social Networks	April 5-10, 2008 · Florence, Italy
bodyText ||| challenges of providing continual feeds between users, and
bodyText ||| the desire of users to control their self-representation via
bodyText ||| such sites.
