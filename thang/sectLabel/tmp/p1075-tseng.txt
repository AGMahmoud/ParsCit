sectionHeader ||| ABSTRACT
bodyText ||| An important question for Human-Computer Interaction is
bodyText ||| to understand how and why visual search strategy is
bodyText ||| adapted to the demands imposed by the task of searching
bodyText ||| the results of a search engine. There is emerging evidence
bodyText ||| that a key part of the answer concerns the expected
bodyText ||| information gain of each of the set of available information
bodyText ||| gathering actions. We build on previous research to show
bodyText ||| that people are acutely sensitive to differences in the density
bodyText ||| and in the number of items returned by the search engine.
bodyText ||| These factors cause shifts in the efficiency of the available
bodyText ||| information gathering actions. We focus on an image
bodyText ||| browsing task, and show that, as a consequence of changes
bodyText ||| to the efficiency of available actions, people make small but
bodyText ||| significant changes to eye-movement strategy.

sectionHeader ||| INTRODUCTION
bodyText ||| An important question for Human-Computer Interaction
bodyText ||| (HCI) is how to design the presentation of search results to
bodyText ||| facilitate visual search behaviour [9,20,35]. Researchers
bodyText ||| have proposed many alternatives to the standard list of
bodyText ||| results. They include Space-filling thumbnails of text [7],
bodyText ||| Tabular interface [36], Faceted category interface [42], and
bodyText ||| Textually-enhanced thumbnails [41].

bodyText ||| The number of proposals is, in part, a reflection of the scale
bodyText ||| of the design space. Identifying which of the potentially
bodyText ||| hundreds of interesting points in this space is best might be
bodyText ||| informed by a theory of how people choose to search
bodyText ||| through results, e.g. an ACT-R or EPIC theory of the
bodyText ||| cognitive, motor, and perceptual processing required to
bodyText ||| achieve the task [2,18,22,23]. Recent efforts to understand,
bodyText ||| what Payne, Howes and Reader [28] call interactive search
bodyText ||| tasks, have included [5,6,8,13,31]. However, it is
bodyText ||| sometimes difficult to ascertain which interface will be best
bodyText ||| when the details of the strategy that people will use given a
bodyText ||| particular task environment are unclear [10,14,17,19]. In
bodyText ||| this paper we are interested in the strategy choices that
bodyText ||| people make about visual search, i.e. how they choose to
bodyText ||| look at search results. Our focus is on the assumption that
bodyText ||| people attempt to maximise expected utility given the
bodyText ||| constraints of the human visual system [8,39] and that
bodyText ||| design changes which change the efficiency of information
bodyText ||| gathering actions will lead to changes in observed
bodyText ||| behaviour.
bodyText ||| There is some evidence in the visual perception and
bodyText ||| cognition literature that visual search strategy is adapted to
bodyText ||| the demands imposed by particular task environments
bodyText ||| [4,26,40]. It appears that people seek to maximise the
bodyText ||| efficiency of visual search in the context of the particular
bodyText ||| display layout. For example, longer fixations enable more
bodyText ||| information to be gathered from fovea and peripheral
bodyText ||| vision, although longer fixations can only be effective if the
bodyText ||| information is available within the perceptual span [26].
bodyText ||| Moreover, people need to manage the trade-off between the
bodyText ||| increased information gain of longer fixations and the effort
bodyText ||| and time cost of holding a fixation.
bodyText ||| Some evidence that people adapt their strategy to the task
bodyText ||| can also be found in the HCI literature. For example, trade-
bodyText ||| offs in the use of wide versus narrow spacing between icons
bodyText ||| [11], in more but smaller text versus fewer but bigger text
bodyText ||| in the same space [15] and in the use of Hyperbolic browser
bodyText ||| versus standard browser [30]. Even in a standard results
bodyText ||| layout, such as a simple list of links, there is evidence that
bodyText ||| search strategy is affected by the context in which the
bodyText ||| relevance of items is assessed [5,6,8,13]. The position of a
bodyText ||| target item in a list and relationship between the relevance
bodyText ||| of this target and distractor items affects search behaviour
page ||| 1075
note ||| CHI 2008 Proceedings · Search	April 5-10, 2008 · Florence, Italy
bodyText ||| [5,6,13]. These finding support the view that search and
bodyText ||| selection is guided by maximising the expected information
bodyText ||| gain [8]. Strikingly there is evidence that maximising
bodyText ||| expected gain can involve fixating on every other item in a
bodyText ||| list, rather than fixating on contiguous items [5,6],
bodyText ||| particularly in contexts where good results have already
bodyText ||| been encountered.
bodyText ||| In a number of respects people appear to be sensitive to the
bodyText ||| expected information gain of information gathering actions.
bodyText ||| In the following section we review in more detail the
bodyText ||| literature on the trade-offs that contribute toward the
bodyText ||| efficiency of information gathering actions during visual
bodyText ||| search. We are interested in the broad class of interactive
bodyText ||| search tasks [28] but our particular focus is on the visual
bodyText ||| search strategies and decision-making processes that people
bodyText ||| use when looking through items returned by an image
bodyText ||| search engine such as Flickr or Google. Further, we are
bodyText ||| interested in everyday tasks with somewhat underspecified
bodyText ||| target criteria, e.g. look for attractive images of the city
bodyText ||| Florence. In what follows we consider the relevance of the
bodyText ||| visual search and HCI literature to understanding these
bodyText ||| kinds of task.
sectionHeader ||| RELATED WORK
subsectionHeader ||| Visual Search in HCI
bodyText ||| Researchers in HCI have suggested that the details of
bodyText ||| interface design affect visual search strategy (e.g.,
bodyText ||| [11,15,30]). Everett and Byrne [11], for example, suggested
bodyText ||| a small difference of 1.6 degrees of visual angle between
bodyText ||| items can result in participants either fixating on an icon or
bodyText ||| not. Similarly, Halverson and Hornof [15] provided
bodyText ||| evidence that low density, task-meaningless large words
bodyText ||| could lead participants to use fewer and shorter fixations
bodyText ||| and so shorter overall search time than when given high
bodyText ||| density, small, task-meaningless, words. Similarly, Pirolli,
bodyText ||| Card, and Van Der Wege [30] found that participants used
bodyText ||| more but shorter fixations when using a Hyperbolic browser
bodyText ||| than when using a standard browser, especially in areas of
bodyText ||| the Hyperbolic browser in which small, low information
bodyText ||| scent items, were grouped closely together.
subsectionHeader ||| Visual Search in Experimental Psychology
bodyText ||| In the visual search literature, there is compelling evidence
bodyText ||| that the density of items on the display has consequences
bodyText ||| for search strategy. Ojanpää, Näsänen and Kojo [26] found
bodyText ||| that decreased spacing in a vertical list of words (common
bodyText ||| Finnish verbs, nouns and adjectives) resulted in longer but
bodyText ||| fewer numerous fixations. Vlaskamp, Over and Hooge [40]
bodyText ||| found that the fixation duration, number of fixation and
bodyText ||| search time increased dramatically with decreasing item
bodyText ||| spacing, as the range of spacing smaller than 1.5° visual
bodyText ||| angle. On the other hand, their data showed that at wide
bodyText ||| spacing range between 1.5° to 7.1° fixation duration,
bodyText ||| number of fixations and search time increased slightly as
bodyText ||| the spacing increased. Bertera and Rayner [4] found that as
bodyText ||| the item spacing increased the number of fixations and
bodyText ||| fixation duration increased.
bodyText ||| Although allowing a high degree of experimental control
bodyText ||| the tasks [4,26,40] lack ecological validity. For example,
bodyText ||| Vlaskamp, Over and Hooge [40] used abstract shapes (e.g.,
bodyText ||| squares) in their search task, and, Bertera and Rayner [4]
bodyText ||| used an unstructured alphanumeric array. Ojanpää, Näsänen
bodyText ||| and Kojo [26]) used common-words, which reduced the
bodyText ||| task to a simple visual pattern match, rather than a match of
bodyText ||| information scent but it is known that search behaviour is
bodyText ||| contingent on label relevance [5,6]. The different materials
bodyText ||| may account for the different effects. Both tasks are far
bodyText ||| from the real HCI task in which the stimuli are more
bodyText ||| heterogeneous and complicated.
subsectionHeader ||| Strategy Change during Search
bodyText ||| Visual search strategies are also known to change during
bodyText ||| the course of a search [27,33]. Over, Hooge, Vlaskamp and
bodyText ||| Erkelens [27] found that fixation duration increased and the
bodyText ||| amplitude of saccade decreased gradually as search
bodyText ||| progressed. They called this is a coarse-to-fine strategy.
bodyText ||| Rao, Zelinsky, Hayhoe and Ballard [33] used a coarse-to-
bodyText ||| fine matching mechanism to model the skipping saccades
bodyText ||| because it could increase the probability of an early match.
bodyText ||| In contrast, Brumby and Howes [6] found a fine-to-coarse
bodyText ||| search strategy. People increased saccade amplitude once
bodyText ||| they had found, but not committed to, a highly relevant
bodyText ||| target suggesting that although it is known that strategy can
bodyText ||| change, the reasons for change are not always clear.
bodyText ||| Also, it is known that people spend more time examining
bodyText ||| items that are presented nearer to the top of the returned
bodyText ||| search results [9,13], presumably, and in part, because
bodyText ||| search engines tend to rank order results. However, what is
bodyText ||| not clear is whether people change visual search strategy as
bodyText ||| they examine links further from the top of the results list.
bodyText ||| For example, they may be more likely to skip i.e. fixate
bodyText ||| alternate, non-adjacent, items once a potential hit has been
bodyText ||| found, as was observed in [6].
sectionHeader ||| THEORY
bodyText ||| We assume that people make strategic adaptations in order
bodyText ||| to improve the efficiency of visual search, that is that they
bodyText ||| rationally adapt the strategy, given cognitive, perceptual,
bodyText ||| and motor constraints, to maximise benefits while
bodyText ||| minimising costs [1,8,17,28,29]. More specifically, people
bodyText ||| adapt their eye movement strategy to maximise the
bodyText ||| expected gain of task-relevant information and minimise the
bodyText ||| neural resources devoted to memory [25] and cognitive and
bodyText ||| attentional load [3]. In this paper, we take an “active vision”
bodyText ||| approach [12] to understanding the complex interactive
bodyText ||| behaviours that people exhibit when searching for
bodyText ||| information. Understanding these behaviours requires
bodyText ||| bridging between theories of visual search, visual
bodyText ||| exploration, and decision-making.
bodyText ||| Following Cox and Young [8] we assumed that people are
bodyText ||| sensitive to the prior probabilities that any particular item
bodyText ||| will be the target item. Cox and Young operationalised this
bodyText ||| assumption by assuming that prior probabilities were
page ||| 1076
note ||| CHI 2008 Proceedings · Search	April 5-10, 2008 · Florence, Italy
bodyText ||| normalized over the set of potential targets. More search
bodyText ||| items implies lower initial priors.
bodyText ||| Following Ojanpää, Näsänen and Kojo [26] we assumed
bodyText ||| that the information that can be gathered given the
bodyText ||| perceptual span is (1) contingent on the item density, (2)
bodyText ||| contingent on the duration of fixation.
bodyText ||| Combining the theories of Cox and Young [8] and Ojanpää,
bodyText ||| Näsänen and Kojo [26] we assume that the visual search
bodyText ||| strategy is rationally adapted to the information that can be
bodyText ||| gained from the perceptual span. On this basis we made
bodyText ||| two predictions:
bodyText ||| (1) that packing items together more closely (high density)
bodyText ||| would allow more information to be harvested from the
bodyText ||| perceptual span given sufficient time. We predicate that
bodyText ||| people would therefore increase the duration spent looking
bodyText ||| at any one item, and reduce the number of items directly
bodyText ||| fixated. That is, they would take advantage of the fact that
bodyText ||| more information was available for each fixation.
bodyText ||| (2) if there are more search items then the gaze durations
bodyText ||| and the rate of number of items directly fixated in a trial
bodyText ||| should decrease because the prior probability of any one
bodyText ||| item being the target item is decreased [8]. In other words,
bodyText ||| when there are more results returned we expect people to
bodyText ||| give each result less time, presumably reducing the quality
bodyText ||| of each evaluation in order to conduct more evaluations.
bodyText ||| The eye movement strategy should switch to a lower cost
bodyText ||| strategy, involving more item skipping [6].
sectionHeader ||| EXPERIMENT
subsectionHeader ||| Method
bodyText ||| This study investigates the consequences of expected
bodyText ||| information gain for the visual search strategy that people
bodyText ||| use given pages of thumbnails returned by a search engine.
bodyText ||| Participants were asked to imagine that they were choosing
bodyText ||| where to go on holiday, and that they were using the web to
bodyText ||| gather information about various places that they could visit.
bodyText ||| In particular, their goal was to use a particular image search
bodyText ||| engine site to find an image of a visually attractive
bodyText ||| destination.
subsubsectionHeader ||| Stimuli and Design
bodyText ||| There were 180 unique sets of images. Each set included
bodyText ||| image thumbnails about a place, such as a resort, city or
bodyText ||| country. These image thumbnails were selected from the
bodyText ||| search results responding to keywords or search phrases
bodyText ||| input in an image search engine of Flickr, a photo sharing
bodyText ||| website. Moreover, each set at least contains 1,000 photo
bodyText ||| results matching the name of the place. For example, Flickr
bodyText ||| found 423,166 up-to-date results for photos matching
bodyText ||| Florence. We filtered out the tourists’ poor quality self-
bodyText ||| portrait, maps and pictures with special effect, such as High
bodyText ||| Dynamic Range (HDR) images which is not clear in the
bodyText ||| task thumbnail size. Finally, we selected 180 photo
bodyText ||| thumbnails for each set. So, totally, we had unique 32,400
bodyText ||| thumbnails (180 sets × 180 thumbnails). At the eye-to-
figureCaption ||| Figure 1: an example of search task with high density
figureCaption ||| layout and one number of pages condition.
figureCaption ||| Figure 2: A sample trial of low density layout and 5 pages
figureCaption ||| set size. This shows the thumbnails on page 3.
bodyText ||| screen distance of 60 centimeters used in the experiment,
bodyText ||| the size of thumbnails (75 × 75 pixels) subtended a visual
bodyText ||| angle of 2.15°.
bodyText ||| The experiment was a within-subjects design and had two
bodyText ||| independent variables. These were thumbnail density and
bodyText ||| number of pages (set size). Density had two levels with
bodyText ||| narrow or wide spacing between items displayed in the
bodyText ||| search task. Figure 1 shows a sample display from one high
bodyText ||| density trial. The edge-to-edge item spacings were 3 pixels
bodyText ||| (visual angle = 0.085°) in high density layout. Figure 2
page ||| 1077
note ||| CHI 2008 Proceedings · Search	April 5-10, 2008 · Florence, Italy
bodyText ||| shows one low density trial. The edge-to-edge item
bodyText ||| spacings were 30 pixels (visual angle = 0.85°) in low
bodyText ||| density display. Unlike in Halverson and Hornof [15] and
bodyText ||| Pirolli, Card, and Van Der Wege [30] the size of thumbnails
bodyText ||| was held constant, so that density was manipulated by
bodyText ||| changing proximity only.
bodyText ||| Number of pages had three levels: 1-page, 2-pages and 5-
bodyText ||| pages. Each page consisted of exactly 36 thumbnails (6 × 6
bodyText ||| square layout). In the 1-page condition, there were 36
bodyText ||| thumbnails in total and the first 36 of 180 thumbnails of
bodyText ||| sets were used. In 2-pages condition, 1st to 36th thumbnails
bodyText ||| were used in the first page; 37th to 72nd thumbnails were
bodyText ||| used in the second page and there were 72 thumbnails in
bodyText ||| total. In the 5-pages condition, all 180 thumbnails were
bodyText ||| used sequentially. There were page links below thumbnails
bodyText ||| in any page. It appeared all the time (see figure 1 and 2).
bodyText ||| Participants could click these links to switch between pages
bodyText ||| during a trial. So, when Participants searched in the first
bodyText ||| page, they also gained the information about how many
bodyText ||| pages in this task.
bodyText ||| In total, there were 6 conditions (2 densities × 3 number of
bodyText ||| pages). Each condition had 30 trials. The total number of
bodyText ||| trials was 180. Each set of thumbnails could be arranged
bodyText ||| into one of six conditions. The presentations of each set of
bodyText ||| thumbnails were counterbalanced across subjects.
subsubsectionHeader ||| Apparatus
bodyText ||| The experiment was performed with a Tobii 1750 eye
bodyText ||| tracker. The eyetracker is embodied in a 17” monitor. The
bodyText ||| eye tracker has a tracking rate or the frame rate of 50 Hz.
bodyText ||| The temporal resolution of 20 ms is sufficient for
bodyText ||| monitoring long fixation and eye movements in our task.
bodyText ||| Although low temporal resolution could cause noise in
bodyText ||| signal sampling, noise was reduced by averaging several
bodyText ||| gazes per page and by testing 30 trials per condition. The
bodyText ||| screen resolutions were set at 1024×768 pixels.
subsubsectionHeader ||| Participants
bodyText ||| Participants were twenty four students from University of
bodyText ||| Manchester who received 5-10 pounds depending on their
bodyText ||| time for their volunteer. All participants were between 18
bodyText ||| and 28 years old and have normal vision or corrected-to-
bodyText ||| normal vision.
subsubsectionHeader ||| Procedure
bodyText ||| Participants were presented with instructions and then a
bodyText ||| practice block allowed them to become familiar with the
bodyText ||| task. After the practice block, the eye tracker system was
bodyText ||| calibrated. And then participants completed all 180 trials.
bodyText ||| The whole Experiment took between 40 minutes and 70
bodyText ||| minutes depending on different participants. The variation
bodyText ||| in time was because we didn’t give our participants any
bodyText ||| time limitation. Some participants were faster than others.
bodyText ||| The participant looked at a place label then clicked on the
bodyText ||| search button to make thumbnail search results appear. The
bodyText ||| participant was instructed to move the cursor to a thumbnail
bodyText ||| of a visually attractive destination and click on it to finish a
bodyText ||| trial. The trial process and interface are shown in Figure 1.
subsectionHeader ||| Results
bodyText ||| Normally, eye movement studies analysed participants’
bodyText ||| search time, number of fixations and fixation duration.
bodyText ||| When we observed the participants’ search behaviour, we
bodyText ||| also found the gaze transitions were not always from one
bodyText ||| item to the next adjacent item; instead, participants skipped
bodyText ||| one or more items during their saccade. We calculated how
bodyText ||| many gaze transitions were not between spatially adjacent
bodyText ||| thumbnails. Therefore, in this study, we were interested in
bodyText ||| visual search performance, particularly in how (1) search
bodyText ||| time and (2) number of item gazes (all contiguous fixations
bodyText ||| on an item were combined to be a single gaze), (3) gaze
bodyText ||| duration (the sum of all fixation durations on a thumbnail
bodyText ||| prior to moving to another thumbnail), and (4) the
bodyText ||| proportion of skipping gaze transitions (the total number of
bodyText ||| gaze transitions divided by the number of skipping gaze
bodyText ||| transitions), are affected by the thumbnails density and
bodyText ||| number of pages. The data in the revisited page were not
bodyText ||| included. These four measures might reveal the adaptation
bodyText ||| of search strategy while participants interact with different
bodyText ||| item densities and number of items.
bodyText ||| We predicted that when the thumbnails were displayed
bodyText ||| close together, participants would spend longer in a gaze,
bodyText ||| and be more likely to skip thumbnails during search in the
bodyText ||| display, than when thumbnails were displayed further apart.
bodyText ||| In addition, page links below the thumbnails indicated that
bodyText ||| the number of pages and total items in the task. We
bodyText ||| predicted that when there are more pages and thumbnails,
bodyText ||| people would adopt a different strategy which would be
bodyText ||| revealed by these four measures.
subsubsectionHeader ||| Overall Performance
bodyText ||| Figure 3 illustrates the overall performance. There were
bodyText ||| significant main density effect on total search time (F(1,23)
bodyText ||| = 23.43, p < 0.001), number of gazes (F(1,23) = 15.87,
bodyText ||| p=0.001), gaze duration (F(1,23) = 17.34, p < 0.001), and
bodyText ||| proportion of skipping gaze transitions (F(1,23) = 35.04,
bodyText ||| p<0.001). The results showed that participant spent less
bodyText ||| time (M = 12,709 ms vs 14,044 ms, figure 3a), fewer gazes
bodyText ||| (M = 8.16 vs 9.28, figure 3b), longer gaze (M = 407 ms vs
bodyText ||| 387 ms, figure 3c) and skipped more often (M = 72.4% vs
bodyText ||| 67.7%, figure 3d) in high versus low density.
bodyText ||| There were significant main number of pages effects on
bodyText ||| total search time (F(2,46) = 136.54, p < 0.001), number of
bodyText ||| gazes (F(2,46) = 73.18, p < 0.001), gaze duration (F(2,46) =
bodyText ||| 10.16, p < 0.001), and proportion of skipping gaze
bodyText ||| transitions (F(2,46) = 8.37, p=0.001). A Bonferroni test
bodyText ||| revealed that every pairwise comparison was significantly
bodyText ||| different (p < 0.05). According to the pairwise comparison,
bodyText ||| participants spent significantly less time (1-page: M = 7,514
bodyText ||| ms, 2-pages: M = 11,482 ms and 5-pages: M = 21,132 ms),
bodyText ||| gazed less (1-page: M = 10.96, 2-pages: M = 15.8 and 5-
bodyText ||| pages: M = 28.02), and skipped less often (1-page: M =
bodyText ||| 66.5%, 2-pages: M = 70.7% and 5-pages: M = 72.9%), in

bodyText ||| the fewer page condition. Also, pairwise comparison
bodyText ||| showed that they spent longer gaze duration in the 1-page
bodyText ||| condition (M = 401 ms) than 5-page condition (M = 369
bodyText ||| ms), although 2-pages is not significant different to 1-page
bodyText ||| and 5-pages condition. There were no significant
bodyText ||| interactions on total search time, number of gazes and gaze
bodyText ||| duration, except proportion of skipping gaze transitions,
bodyText ||| F(2,46) = 3.73, p < 0.05.
bodyText ||| Moreover, following Reiman, Young and Howes [34], we
bodyText ||| analysed the revisiting. Figure 4a shows the number of
bodyText ||| items that were visited at least once and revisited (i.e.
bodyText ||| visited at least twice) for each experimental condition.
bodyText ||| Participant revisited around 22% to 27% of visited items for
bodyText ||| each condition. Density and number of pages had similar
bodyText ||| effects on the number of visited and the number of revisited
bodyText ||| items. Participants visited and revisited more items in low
bodyText ||| density (all p’s < 0.01) and when there were more pages (a
bodyText ||| Bonferroni test for analysing three page levels showed
bodyText ||| every pair was significantly different, p < 0.001). In
bodyText ||| number of pages
figureCaption ||| Figure 4: (a) mean number of items visited at least once
figureCaption ||| (bars with solid pattern) and items visited at least twice
figureCaption ||| (bars with line pattern) and (b) mean duration of an item
figureCaption ||| visited at the first time visit (bars with solid pattern) and
figureCaption ||| at the second time visit (bars with line pattern).
bodyText ||| addition, figure 4b shows that our participants spent more
bodyText ||| time on an item when they revisited it than when they
bodyText ||| visited it the fist time, F(1,20) = 99.788, P < 0.001.
bodyText ||| Performance in the First Page
bodyText ||| We analysed data in more detail. In this section we contrast
bodyText ||| performance in the first page of each condition. (Not all
bodyText ||| conditions had subsequent pages so the first page provides
bodyText ||| the critical test. In addition, it is the first page behaviour
bodyText ||| that should be affected by information about the number of
bodyText ||| pages, rather than by the quality of the additional items.)
bodyText ||| We analysed our four measures (search time, number of
bodyText ||| gazes, gaze duration and skipping rate) taken from the first
bodyText ||| page of search results. We conducted a 2 × 3 (density ×
bodyText ||| number of pages) repeated-measure ANOVA for each
bodyText ||| measure separately.
bodyText ||| Duration on a page was defined as the total time from the
bodyText ||| display onset to the time leaving the first page by click a
bodyText ||| page number link, or from the onset to the start of
bodyText ||| participants’ last fixation on the clicked target.
bodyText ||| As expected, there was a main effect of density on mean
bodyText ||| search time in the first page, F(1,23) = 28.27, p < 0.001.
bodyText ||| The search performance in the fist page was quicker in high
bodyText ||| density (M = 6082.24 ms) than low density (M = 6742.9
bodyText ||| ms). There was also a main effect of number of pages on
bodyText ||| search time of the first page, F(2,46) = 15.82,p < 0.001.

bodyText ||| Figure 5c illustrates mean first page gaze duration.
bodyText ||| Participants’ mean gaze duration in the first page was
bodyText ||| longer in the high density (M = 407 ms) than low density
bodyText ||| layout (M = 387.259 ms), F(1,23) = 22.414, p < 0.001. The
bodyText ||| main effect of number of pages was not significant. There
bodyText ||| was no interaction between density and number of pages.
bodyText ||| Figure 5d shows the data of mean proportion of first page
bodyText ||| skipping gaze transitions. The density had significant effect,
bodyText ||| F (1, 23) = 46.72, p < 0.001. It was found that that
bodyText ||| participants were more likely to skip thumbnails in the high
bodyText ||| density (M = 72%) than in the low density layout (M =

subsubsectionHeader ||| Performance per Page
bodyText ||| Figure 6 summarises the mean performance of our eighteen
bodyText ||| participants’ eye movement behaviour in the high density
bodyText ||| condition. (All results of the low density condition has the
bodyText ||| same trend as in the high density condition) Figure 6a
bodyText ||| shows mean search duration per page, figure 6b shows
bodyText ||| mean number of gazes per page, figure 6c shows mean gaze
bodyText ||| duration per page and figure 6d shows the proportion of
bodyText ||| skipping gaze transitions in number of pages condition.
bodyText ||| Each bar within a page condition shows the performance on
bodyText ||| each page of that condition. For example, the only bar in the
bodyText ||| 1-page condition shows performance in the 1-page
bodyText ||| condition, the two bars in 2-pages condition show each
bodyText ||| performance in page 1 and 2 and the five bars in 5-page
bodyText ||| condition show each performance from page 1 to page 5,
bodyText ||| from left to right respectively.
bodyText ||| When we examined whether participants adopted different
bodyText ||| strategies in different pages in a search course, the values of
bodyText ||| four measures of search performance were taken from each
bodyText ||| page.
bodyText ||| Because there were four participants who didn’t have data
bodyText ||| in all five pages in the 5-page condition, we took out these
bodyText ||| four participants. Then, we arbitrarily selected and removed
bodyText ||| another two participants from the analysis to keep the
bodyText ||| counterbalanced design. Therefore, in this section, the
bodyText ||| results were from analysing eighteen participants’ data. The
bodyText ||| following analyses were conducted in 2-pages and 5-pages
bodyText ||| condition separately.
bodyText ||| In the 2-pages condition, every measure of four search
bodyText ||| performance of participants was not significantly different
bodyText ||| in page 1 and page2. it indicated that the search strategy did
bodyText ||| not vary in the first and second page, when participants
bodyText ||| search in a 2-pages display (see Figure 6a, b, c, d, 2-pages
bodyText ||| condition).
bodyText ||| In 5-pages condition, the results of a 5×2 repeated-measure
bodyText ||| ANOVA (page number: page 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 × density:
bodyText ||| high and low) showed there were main effect of page
bodyText ||| number and density on every measure of search
bodyText ||| performance our participants’ performance (see Figure 6 a,
bodyText ||| b, c, d, 5-pages condition). The results of search
bodyText ||| performance per page in the 5-pages condition are
bodyText ||| summarized in Table 1. In general, search performance was
bodyText ||| in page number 1 is different to other pages.
bodyText ||| pairwise comparisons of page number with Bonferroni
bodyText ||| method in search duration, number of gazes, and proportion
bodyText ||| of skipping gaze transitions showed that the measures in
bodyText ||| page 1 were different from those in page 2 to page 5 (pair
bodyText ||| between page 1 and any other page was significant, p<0.01
bodyText ||| and pair between page 2 to page 5 were not significant
bodyText ||| different). There was a significant difference between page
bodyText ||| 1 and page 3 in gaze duration. Although any other pair does
bodyText ||| not reach significant, there was a trend for people to take
bodyText ||| longer gaze on page 1 than on pages 2, 3, 4, or 5. This
bodyText ||| indicated that participants search in the first page more
bodyText ||| carefully than other pages.

bodyText ||| items were available within the perceptual span (higher
bodyText ||| density), longer item visits were used, and when fewer
bodyText ||| items were available (lower density), shorter item visits
bodyText ||| were used. Longer visits were only used when they were
bodyText ||| efficient, i.e. when expected information gain was high.
bodyText ||| 2. Longer visits to items were combined with skipping.
bodyText ||| Participants in the high density conditions skipped items
bodyText ||| more often, visited fewer items, and spent less time
bodyText ||| searching overall.	In other words, when the potential
bodyText ||| information gain for longer visits was high, people made
bodyText ||| more use of longer visits and reduced the number of items
bodyText ||| that they directly fixated. They made more use of the
bodyText ||| perceptual span when it was rational given the constraints
bodyText ||| of the visual system to do so, and gained an overall
bodyText ||| reduction in the required search time.
bodyText ||| 3. Participants were observed to reduce the number of items
bodyText ||| that they visited, i.e. they skipped, when there was a larger
bodyText ||| number of items (Figure 5d) but without increasing the
bodyText ||| duration spent attending to each item (Figure 5c). These
bodyText ||| findings suggest that skipping was sensitive to the prior
bodyText ||| probability that any one item would be attractive enough to
bodyText ||| be selected but that gaze duration was not.
bodyText ||| 4. Participants spent more time on an item, when they
bodyText ||| revisited it than when they visited it for the first time. this
bodyText ||| findings indicates that people may use an iterative
bodyText ||| deepening of attention [34]. This strategy may help
bodyText ||| participants to parse large amounts of information quickly
bodyText ||| using lower tolerance to rule out poor quality items and
bodyText ||| then focus effort on a smaller set. The difference between
bodyText ||| [34] and our study is that our participants didn’t sample all
bodyText ||| items before they started to revisit, especially in conditions
bodyText ||| with more pages (Figure 4b). This finding suggests that the
bodyText ||| set size of potential items may be constrained by the
bodyText ||| capacity limitation in memory. We also observed
bodyText ||| participants select an item at the first time visit before
bodyText ||| sampling all items. This indicated that people also picked
bodyText ||| an item immediately when the value of the item currently
bodyText ||| visited is beyond their satisficing criteria [38]. Adopting the
bodyText ||| coarse-to-fine strategy [27,33] and employing satisficing
bodyText ||| [38] could save lots of visual processing cost for sampling
bodyText ||| out poor items quickly and gain an item with satisficing
bodyText ||| value or gain a revisited item with acceptable value.
bodyText ||| In sum, the results support the view that people adjusted
bodyText ||| their visual search strategy to their expectations of
bodyText ||| information gain, and that these expectations were
bodyText ||| contingent on (a) the density of items, and (b) the prior
bodyText ||| likelihood that an item is the one that they will want to
bodyText ||| select. In the remainder of the Discussion we first offer
bodyText ||| further explanations for the details of the findings, we then
bodyText ||| discuss some design implications.
subsectionHeader ||| Further Explanations
bodyText ||| Why, for some designs, is it more efficient to use fewer
bodyText ||| longer gazes than more, shorter, ones? Essentially, because
bodyText ||| planning and executing gaze transitions, saccades, is
bodyText ||| expensive. Planning and executing a new gaze so as to
bodyText ||| bring a foveal fixation to a new place requires effort, both
bodyText ||| mental and physical effort. Neurophysiological evidence
bodyText ||| indicates that making a saccade involves high cost neural
bodyText ||| processes to keep the visual scene stable (see [37] review).
bodyText ||| Therefore, to prolong an old gaze to gain information about
bodyText ||| an adjacent item can cost less than to plan and execute a
bodyText ||| new gaze. For example, in our experiment a new item visit
bodyText ||| took an extra 400 ms, but a longer gaze took only about 20
bodyText ||| ms more. Although each longer gaze takes more time, fewer
bodyText ||| gazes are required, reducing the overall visual search time.
bodyText ||| Why was it not possible for participants to increase
bodyText ||| perceptual span to cover adjacent items in lower density
bodyText ||| displays? Findings reported by Hooge, Vlaskamp and Over
bodyText ||| [16] suggest that information can be gathered from a wider
bodyText ||| area of a display as gaze durations increase, i.e. it is
bodyText ||| possible that perceptual span is itself contingent on duration
bodyText ||| of fixation. However, there are clearly limits [4], and it
bodyText ||| appears as though the reduction in the rate that information
bodyText ||| can be acquired caused by the lower densities in our
bodyText ||| experiment pushed participants beyond this limit.
bodyText ||| Will the findings generalise to other types of search result
bodyText ||| items? There is some evidence that the finding would
bodyText ||| generalise to word items. For example, Pollatsek, Perea
bodyText ||| and Binder [32] found that fixation duration is longer when
bodyText ||| a word with more neighbours than few neighbours. Longer
bodyText ||| fixation duration in a more dense display suggests that more
bodyText ||| information within the perceptual span is required to be
bodyText ||| processed serially. In contrast, Motter and Belky [24]
bodyText ||| showed that fixation duration didn’t change as the number
bodyText ||| of items within a 4° constant area and assumed that this
bodyText ||| result is because items surrounding a fixation are processed
bodyText ||| in parallel (number of items surrounded the fixation will not
bodyText ||| affect the fixation duration). These contrary results could be
bodyText ||| because of the relative complexities of stimuli in these two
bodyText ||| tasks are so different. Simple items, e.g. symbols, adjacent
bodyText ||| to a fixation can be processed in parallel, but complex items
bodyText ||| such photographic thumbnails in our task have to be
bodyText ||| processed in series and result in longer durations.
bodyText ||| Why do the findings differ from previous research? The
bodyText ||| importance of ecological validity. The observed density
bodyText ||| effect on gaze duration and number of gazes are consistent
bodyText ||| with some previous studies [26], but contrary to others
bodyText ||| [4,15]. Unlike most of the previous studies, our target was
bodyText ||| not defined by only one or two visual features (color, shape,
bodyText ||| and orientation et al.) or non-words (non-words without
bodyText ||| semantic meaning can be searched by their shape or the
bodyText ||| order of characters), but was, instead, informed by the
bodyText ||| semantic description of a place. In contrast to these
bodyText ||| previous studies, participants in our study had to search a
bodyText ||| target based on aesthetic judgment. They spent longer gaze
bodyText ||| duration in our task than normal visual search task. These
bodyText ||| differences in the task environment may lead to the
bodyText ||| different results of the effect on search performance.
bodyText ||| Ecological validity is therefore crucial to understanding the
bodyText ||| constraints on visual search strategy.

bodyText ||| On the other hand, we have chosen to control some
bodyText ||| variables that are confounded in studies of potential new
bodyText ||| designs. For example, in studies of hyperbolic browsers
bodyText ||| [30] item size and item density are confounded, i.e. items
bodyText ||| that are close together are also smaller than items that are
bodyText ||| further apart. Although this is perhaps, a natural confound
bodyText ||| for systems like hyperbolic browsers, failing to isolate what
bodyText ||| are otherwise independent factors will limit the generality
bodyText ||| of conclusions drawn from the data.
bodyText ||| A downside of our effort to engage our participants in a
bodyText ||| meaningful task -- looking for attractive images of potential
bodyText ||| destinations -- was that there was a weak criterion for
bodyText ||| successful trial completion. The trial was over when
bodyText ||| participants indicated that they had found an attractive
bodyText ||| thumbnail but some participants may have used radically
bodyText ||| different thresholds for ‘attractive’ than others. In contrast,
bodyText ||| experiments in which participants were asked to find a
bodyText ||| particular item have a strong and measurable criterion for
bodyText ||| trial completion and moreover participants can make errors.
bodyText ||| Although we claim that our design reflects some part of the
bodyText ||| natural task ecology, it also reduces the strength of the
bodyText ||| conclusions that we can draw from the fact that participants
bodyText ||| took less time, overall, when items were presented with a
bodyText ||| higher density.
subsectionHeader ||| Design Implications
bodyText ||| A persistent problem for HCI is that the exploration of new
bodyText ||| designs in the absence of adequate empirically grounded
bodyText ||| theory might lead to the rejection of the design on the basis
bodyText ||| of false negatives. Hyperbolic or other fish-eye view
bodyText ||| projections have, for example, had no impact on the way
bodyText ||| that most people use computer systems, despite the huge
bodyText ||| research investment over many years. It is tempting to take
bodyText ||| this fact as evidence that hyperbolic browsers are not fit for
bodyText ||| purpose. However, an alternative reason for their failure to
bodyText ||| find a role might be that the particular design instances are
bodyText ||| not tuned to the detailed constraints and adaptive capability
bodyText ||| of the human visual system. Hyperbolic browsers that fail
bodyText ||| to let people adapt to the constraints and capabilities
bodyText ||| imposed by their visual system are unlikely to succeed.
bodyText ||| Careful empirical investigation in response to well-formed
bodyText ||| theory and motivated by the ecology of user’s real task
bodyText ||| environments may have the potential to address this
bodyText ||| problem.
bodyText ||| For example, although users might adapt their search
bodyText ||| strategy to achieve the highest payoff given a particular
bodyText ||| thumbnail density, some layout designs are better for
bodyText ||| decreasing of total search time and manual response time.
bodyText ||| The results reported above suggest the high density (3
bodyText ||| pixels gap between thumbnails) can facilitate search.
bodyText ||| Interestingly, even higher densities than we have explored
bodyText ||| in this paper are unlikely to produce further gains. Previous
bodyText ||| work [21] has suggested that when the spacing between
bodyText ||| icons is zero pixels search becomes more difficult.
bodyText ||| Thumbnails require at least some space for visual search,
bodyText ||| which perhaps reflects common intuitions.
