sectionHeader ||| ABSTRACT
bodyText ||| Web 2.0 gives people a substantial role in content and
bodyText ||| metadata creation. New interpersonal connections are
bodyText ||| formed and existing connections become evident. This
bodyText ||| newly created social network (SN) spans across multiple
bodyText ||| services and aggregating it could bring great value. In this
bodyText ||| work we present SONAR, an API for gathering and sharing
bodyText ||| SN information. We give a detailed description of SONAR,
bodyText ||| demonstrate its potential value through user scenarios, and
bodyText ||| show results from experiments we conducted with a
bodyText ||| SONAR-based social networking application within our
bodyText ||| organizational intranet. These suggest that aggregating SN
bodyText ||| information across diverse data sources enriches the SN
bodyText ||| picture and makes it more complete and useful for the end
bodyText ||| user.

bodyText ||| Social software – software that has people as its focal point
bodyText ||| – is the core of Web 2.0. From blogs and wikis through
bodyText ||| recommender systems to social bookmarking and personal
bodyText ||| network systems – social applications proliferate. In
bodyText ||| continuation to its dominance on the internet, social
bodyText ||| software has recently emerged in organizations, as a mean
bodyText ||| of connecting employees in a better way and enhancing
bodyText ||| knowledge management and expertise location. Blogging

bodyText ||| [7], are examples of social applications that became part of
bodyText ||| organizations’ intranets in the purpose of promoting intra-
bodyText ||| organizational interaction.
bodyText ||| Many of these social applications expose interesting
bodyText ||| information about people’s relationships. For example, by
bodyText ||| analysing blog commenters, or bookmarking similarities,
bodyText ||| connections among people can become evident. By
bodyText ||| extracting this information and aggregating it across
bodyText ||| multiple sources, a comprehensive and often intriguing
bodyText ||| picture of individual and organizational social networks
bodyText ||| may be revealed.
bodyText ||| Potential sources of social information are very diverse.
bodyText ||| Different users make use of different tools, and social
bodyText ||| information is scattered among many services and
bodyText ||| applications. As these applications rarely interoperate, each
bodyText ||| is typically only aware of its own social data and cannot
bodyText ||| benefit from other applications’ data.
bodyText ||| The diversity of sources of social networking data also
bodyText ||| brings a variety of semantics to interpersonal connections.
bodyText ||| While some of these semantics are straightforward and
bodyText ||| derived from the nature of the connection (brother, close
bodyText ||| friend, manager, etc.), others are more complex. Many
bodyText ||| researchers recognized that people are connected through
bodyText ||| artifacts. For example, many studies have investigated
bodyText ||| networks where two people are connected if they have co-
bodyText ||| authored a paper [22]. Newer examples of artifacts that
bodyText ||| connect people include email messages [3,28], and web
bodyText ||| pages [14]. Affiliation networks [29] present people’s
bodyText ||| connections through groups in which they co-participate,
bodyText ||| such as a board of directors, or a movie cast [22]. The
bodyText ||| above examples imply that aggregating social network data
bodyText ||| presents the challenge of creating a single framework,
bodyText ||| general yet informative, to fit all types of connections.
bodyText ||| To address the above challenges, we introduce SONAR
bodyText ||| (Social Networks Architecture) – an API for sharing social
bodyText ||| network data and aggregating it across applications to show
bodyText ||| who is related to whom and how. Applications
bodyText ||| implementing the SONAR API (SONAR providers) should
bodyText ||| provide internal information about how strongly people are
bodyText ||| connected and by what means. SONAR clients can use the
bodyText ||| SONAR API to access data from a single provider that
bodyText ||| implements the API. However, the more compelling case is
page ||| 1017
note ||| CHI 2008 Proceedings · Online Social Networks	April 5-10, 2008 · Florence, Italy
bodyText ||| where an intermediate component, an aggregator, is used
bodyText ||| by clients, with the very same SONAR API, to consolidate
bodyText ||| the data from different providers. This way, one can choose
bodyText ||| multiple providers and assign an appropriate weight to each
bodyText ||| of them. It is expected that federating more data providers
bodyText ||| will make the resulting answers to queries more complete.
bodyText ||| Clients of SONAR may vary from expertise miners,
bodyText ||| through network visualizers, to user interface widgets.
bodyText ||| SONAR answers questions such as “who does this person
bodyText ||| communicate with most?”, “what are all the artifacts co-
bodyText ||| authored by these two individuals?”, “whom should I invite
bodyText ||| to a brainstorm on a certain topic?”
bodyText ||| SONAR includes two types of data sources: personal
bodyText ||| (private) and public. Personal sources, such as email and
bodyText ||| instant messaging (IM), are only available to their owner
bodyText ||| and reflect the owner’s personal, or egocentric, social
bodyText ||| network (i.e., all nodes in the network are directly related to
bodyText ||| the owner). Public data sources, such as blogs and
bodyText ||| organizational charts, are available to all users and reflect
bodyText ||| their extended, or sociocentric, network. SONAR maintains
bodyText ||| the privacy model of its data sources: only those users who
bodyText ||| have access to a certain piece of data by the original
bodyText ||| provider will have access to the social information extracted
bodyText ||| from this data by SONAR.
bodyText ||| As of now, we implemented the SONAR API for over ten
bodyText ||| sources, public and personal, within the IBM intranet.
bodyText ||| SONAR’s ultimate goal is to be widely used by social
bodyText ||| networking and Web 2.0 services on the internet and to
bodyText ||| define a standard, analogous to RSS [11]. SONAR is based
bodyText ||| on the REST design pattern [9] and uses standard data
bodyText ||| formats such as Atom [23] and JSON [13].
bodyText ||| When used for creating a sociocentric view of a social
bodyText ||| network, SONAR is based solely on public sources. Any
bodyText ||| user may use this view to examine publicly visible
bodyText ||| connections within any group of people. When used for
bodyText ||| creating an egocentric view of a user’s network, SONAR
bodyText ||| also makes use of the user’s personal sources. Enriching the
bodyText ||| egocentric network, as reflected in personal sources, with
bodyText ||| information from public sources, opens up new
bodyText ||| opportunities for learning about one’s extended network
bodyText ||| (i.e., one’s connections and their connections with others).
bodyText ||| Consider, for example, Alice who seeks a social connection
bodyText ||| to Cindy. Cindy may not appear at all in Alice’s egocentric
bodyText ||| network based on personal sources. However, examining
bodyText ||| the extended network, Alice may discover that Bob – who
bodyText ||| appears on her egocentric network by her personal data – is
bodyText ||| related to Cindy according to public sources. Alice will then
bodyText ||| be able to discover a social path to Cindy through Bob,
bodyText ||| based on aggregation of her personal and public sources.
bodyText ||| In order to verify the fundamental concepts on which
bodyText ||| SONAR relies, namely aggregation and the usage of public
bodyText ||| sources, we conducted three experiments. The first
bodyText ||| experiment examines different social networks derived
bodyText ||| from four of SONAR’s implemented public data sources.
bodyText ||| The second experiment involves a user study in which over
bodyText ||| a hundred users evaluated different buddylists derived from
bodyText ||| 24 different combinations of SONAR public as well as
bodyText ||| personal data sources. For the third experiment we
bodyText ||| interviewed 12 users about their usage of a SONAR UI and
bodyText ||| their thoughts on the different buddylists. The experiments
bodyText ||| examine the diversity of the public data sources, their value
bodyText ||| to the user, and whether they add value over personal data
bodyText ||| sources. Finally, we checked whether there exists an ideal
bodyText ||| weighting scheme of the sources, which may serve as the
bodyText ||| system’s default, and followed users as they were
bodyText ||| composing their own ideal weighting scheme.
bodyText ||| We note that the experiments in this paper examine
bodyText ||| buddylists and social networks generally, while, in practice,
bodyText ||| different semantics may yield different social networks. For
bodyText ||| example, the network consisting of users’ friends may be
bodyText ||| different from the network of people with whom users
bodyText ||| communicate most frequently, which may be different from
bodyText ||| the network of individuals with whom users share similar
bodyText ||| interests.
bodyText ||| The rest of the paper is organized as follows. The next
bodyText ||| section surveys related work, followed by a more detailed
bodyText ||| description of SONAR and typical usage scenarios. We
bodyText ||| then describe our hypotheses, research method, and results.
bodyText ||| The final section discusses conclusions and future work.
sectionHeader ||| RELATED WORK
bodyText ||| The formal discipline that studies interpersonal connections
bodyText ||| is called social network analysis (SNA) [29]. A social
bodyText ||| network (SN) is a graph that represents social entities and
bodyText ||| relationships between them. SNs have often been studied
bodyText ||| through the use of social science tools such as surveys and
bodyText ||| interviews, which require a great deal of human labor. The
bodyText ||| evolution of the Web, which is often referred to as Web 2.0
bodyText ||| [24], has introduced new possibilities for SN research.
subsectionHeader ||| Gathering SN Data from Computer Applications
bodyText ||| There are several popular SN services on the Web, which
bodyText ||| help to connect friends and business acquaintances1. These
bodyText ||| services define an explicit SN. Users directly specify who
bodyText ||| their friends are and often manually state the nature of the
bodyText ||| connection. The manual nature of these networks is perhaps
bodyText ||| their main disadvantage. Only part of the user’s actual SN
bodyText ||| will be registered in any such application, and since
bodyText ||| explicitly entering social data is tedious, even users who are
bodyText ||| registered are likely to have incomplete information about
bodyText ||| their network. These applications are useful for SONAR,
bodyText ||| providing very accurate, even if partial, social connections.
bodyText ||| The wealth of information in computer databases and
bodyText ||| applications is a good source for automatically obtaining
bodyText ||| various kinds of SN data without burdening users with the
bodyText ||| manual management of their network. For example,
bodyText ||| Wellman views computer networks as SNs and surveys
bodyText ||| how computer networks reflect and affect traditional SNs
footnote ||| 1 {myspace, facebook, linkedin, orkut, friendster}.com
page ||| 1018
note ||| CHI 2008 Proceedings · Online Social Networks	April 5-10, 2008 · Florence, Italy
bodyText ||| [30]. In addition, data mining can discover subtle details of
bodyText ||| a relationship that a person may not be able to provide
bodyText ||| accurately. For example, the rate of email communication
bodyText ||| can be used to estimate the strength of social ties [19].
bodyText ||| Email is commonly used to extract SNs. Extraction of the
bodyText ||| sociocentric SN from email logs has been demonstrated in
bodyText ||| [28] in order to automatically identify communities. Other
bodyText ||| tools, such as ContactMap [19] and Personal Map [8],
bodyText ||| analyze emails to extract the user’s egocentric SN. Email is
bodyText ||| one of the important sources for SONAR, but it is definitely
bodyText ||| not the only one. SONAR’s philosophy states that there is
bodyText ||| much important social information outside the inbox.
bodyText ||| Another common source for SN information is the Web.
bodyText ||| Adamic et al. [1] describe techniques for mining links and
bodyText ||| text of homepages to predict social relationships. The
bodyText ||| strength of a connection between two people can be
bodyText ||| estimated by querying a search engine with their names and
bodyText ||| checking for web pages where they co-occur [14,17]. Since
bodyText ||| various data sources such as papers, organizational charts,
bodyText ||| and net-news archives are available on the internet or
bodyText ||| intranet, they too could be mined by web searching [14].
bodyText ||| SN extraction has been conducted on many other sources,
bodyText ||| including Usenet data [27] and Instant Messaging logs [25].
subsectionHeader ||| Public vs. Personal Data Sources
bodyText ||| Sociocentric network approaches may encounter difficulties
bodyText ||| using personal data sources due to privacy concerns. For
bodyText ||| example, mining email, even when results are displayed in
bodyText ||| aggregated forms, might expose private information [14].
bodyText ||| One solution is to limit data mining to public sources. For
bodyText ||| example, Aleman-Meza et al. [2] chose to aggregate only
bodyText ||| publicly available SN data due to privacy concerns.
bodyText ||| However, ignoring private information may exclude
bodyText ||| important data. An alternative solution is to have users opt-
bodyText ||| in to explicitly give permission to make certain private
bodyText ||| information public. For example, Smarr [26] suggests
bodyText ||| requiring users to opt-in to publish their information to a
bodyText ||| public Friend of a Friend (FOAF) file [10]. However, opt-in
bodyText ||| requires action and motivation on the part of users – so
bodyText ||| those publishing their FOAF files will cover only a small
bodyText ||| percentage of organization members.
bodyText ||| SONAR can aggregate both private and public sources,
bodyText ||| without exposing private data to other people, or requiring
bodyText ||| users to opt-in.
subsectionHeader ||| Aggregating SN Data from Different Sources
bodyText ||| No single archive or tool captures all our social relations
bodyText ||| with others. Aggregating SN data from several sources may
bodyText ||| improve the completeness of constructed SNs. For example,
bodyText ||| the ContactMap developers plan to extend their email
bodyText ||| mining tool to use sources such as voice mail and phone
bodyText ||| logs due to user complaints on the absence of phone-based
bodyText ||| contacts [19].
bodyText ||| Several tools combine different sources to generate better
bodyText ||| SNs. In [5], an email database is used to extract people
bodyText ||| names and email addresses – these are then searched on the
bodyText ||| Web, to extract keywords and to find additional related
bodyText ||| people for which the search is recursively applied. Web
bodyText ||| mining, face-to-face communication, and manually entering
bodyText ||| one’s SN are combined in [12] to construct the SN in a
bodyText ||| Japanese conference.
bodyText ||| A basic problem of aggregation is deciding on the
bodyText ||| algorithm to be used for combining data from various
bodyText ||| sources. A simple approach is to compute the aggregation
bodyText ||| as a linear combination of the individual sources. Cai et al.
bodyText ||| [4] propose a method for learning the optimal linear
bodyText ||| combination given input from the user that describes the
bodyText ||| user’s expectation. However, this method requires the user
bodyText ||| to specify the query in ways which may prove to be
bodyText ||| complex. Matsuo et al. [16] extract and integrate SNs from
bodyText ||| several different sources. They provide a rough sketch for
bodyText ||| integrating the networks into a single one by using a linear
bodyText ||| combination of the different networks. Our research tests
bodyText ||| whether there is a weighting scheme which is appropriate to
bodyText ||| most users, for a specific scenario.
subsectionHeader ||| Evaluation of Social Network Quality
bodyText ||| A common approach for validating an automatically
bodyText ||| constructed SN is to ask the people in the network about its
bodyText ||| correctness, usually by questionnaires that require rating
bodyText ||| various aspects of the SNs and/or providing open-ended
bodyText ||| feedback [8,19,28].
bodyText ||| Another possible approach used in SNA is to compare the
bodyText ||| automatically constructed network to external data. For
bodyText ||| example, Aleman-Meza et al. [2] detect conflict of interests
bodyText ||| between paper authors and referees by integrating data from
bodyText ||| several SNs. Their evaluation included comparison to data
bodyText ||| from an external source: a different existing system for
bodyText ||| detecting conflict of interest. The problem with this method
bodyText ||| of evaluation is that it is possible only if there exists a
bodyText ||| relevant external source, which can be used for comparison.
bodyText ||| This paper includes three types of evaluation. In the
bodyText ||| absence of an external source to compare to when
bodyText ||| evaluating an aggregated network, our first evaluation
bodyText ||| compares the networks obtained from individual sources to
bodyText ||| the other sources, to measure their uniqueness. The second
bodyText ||| evaluation is a user evaluation, where we evaluate and
bodyText ||| compare numerous linear combinations of different sources.
bodyText ||| The third evaluation employs interviews in order to receive
bodyText ||| user feedback on individual sources and their aggregation.
sectionHeader ||| SONAR IN DETAIL
bodyText ||| The purpose of the SONAR API is to provide open
bodyText ||| interfaces to SN data, “locked up” in a multitude of
bodyText ||| systems. SONAR specifies a way to share weighted SNs as
bodyText ||| relation lists. Clients may retrieve information about how
bodyText ||| people are connected based on different parameters. Like
bodyText ||| RSS, our goal is to make a read-only interface, simple to
bodyText ||| implement by the provider and consume by the client.
page ||| 1019
note ||| CHI 2008 Proceedings · Online Social Networks	April 5-10, 2008 · Florence, Italy
bodyText ||| The first premise behind the SONAR API is that it is
bodyText ||| necessary to present the strength of ties between people. In
bodyText ||| contrast to APIs for specific SN applications like Facebook
bodyText ||| [6], SONAR does not model any specific semantics of the
bodyText ||| underlying system like “friending” or “communities”.
bodyText ||| Instead, it asks providers to boil down these semantics into
bodyText ||| floating point numbers between 0 and 1. SONAR
bodyText ||| aggregators combine results from multiple systems using a
bodyText ||| simple weighted average. This approach enables diverse
bodyText ||| applications from instant messaging clients through
bodyText ||| publication databases to SN sites to provide data supporting
bodyText ||| an aggregated view of relationships among people. SONAR
bodyText ||| clients are oblivious to the types of relations – when
bodyText ||| querying for strength of a relationship, all that the client
bodyText ||| sees is people and the weight of their associations.
bodyText ||| Users of aggregated SN data frequently want to understand
bodyText ||| how people are connected, or why a connection is stronger
bodyText ||| than another. To support this need, SONAR allows queries
bodyText ||| for evidence. Evidence is essentially a time-ordered log of
bodyText ||| entries, originating from each of the providers. It may
bodyText ||| include comments posted by one user in the other user’s
bodyText ||| blog, email messages or chat transcripts between them, or
bodyText ||| web sites that they both bookmarked. According to our
bodyText ||| privacy model, users do not have access to any private
bodyText ||| material of other people through this interface—it just
bodyText ||| organizes information they already had access to before.
subsectionHeader ||| SONAR API Specification
bodyText ||| We have implemented SONAR as a REST API. The API
bodyText ||| has four methods. The first three are fetching weighted
bodyText ||| people relationships, while the fourth provides evidence for
bodyText ||| connections. The methods are summarized in Table 1.
subsectionHeader ||| SONAR Aggregator
bodyText ||| SONAR is designed to enable an aggregator component
bodyText ||| that merges results from multiple providers. Like an HTTP
bodyText ||| proxy, the aggregator protocol is in most ways identical to
bodyText ||| the protocol for interacting with a SONAR provider. In fact,
bodyText ||| clients communicate with aggregators the exact same way
bodyText ||| they do with primary providers – through the SONAR API.
bodyText ||| The aggregator is configured to connect to one or more
bodyText ||| providers. When a request is received, the aggregator
bodyText ||| forwards it to each provider. It then processes the results by
bodyText ||| computing a weighted average and returns the result to the
bodyText ||| user. The original results from the different sources remain
bodyText ||| transparent to the user.

subsectionHeader ||| SONAR Providers
bodyText ||| We have implemented SONAR providers of over ten
bodyText ||| sources in our organizational intranet. The following four
bodyText ||| systems, which serve as public sources, were used in our
bodyText ||| experiments: BlogCentral (IBM’s corporate blogging
bodyText ||| system [14]), Fringe, for people tagging and friending [7],
bodyText ||| Dogear, for social bookmarking [19], and the IBM
bodyText ||| organizational chart.
bodyText ||| For the blog system, social relations are derived from the
bodyText ||| comments made to one’s blog. This information is an
bodyText ||| indication of the people who leave a trace in a blog, which
bodyText ||| is likely to imply that the author is aware of them. Fringe
bodyText ||| supports extraction of social information of both friending
bodyText ||| and tagging. Friending is a reciprocal action: one person
bodyText ||| invites the other to be friends and they are defined friends
bodyText ||| only if the invitation is accepted. Tagging people is one
bodyText ||| sided, yet indicates some level of connection. The SONAR
bodyText ||| provider that extracts SNs from Dogear is based on
bodyText ||| bookmark similarity information. The connections returned
bodyText ||| by this provider are those of people who bookmark the
bodyText ||| same pages. From the organizational chart we extracted, for
bodyText ||| each user, the user’s manager as well as the user’s direct
bodyText ||| peers - all employees who have the same manager.
bodyText ||| We have implemented several client-side SONAR
bodyText ||| providers that have access to the user’s private data. The
bodyText ||| experiments in this paper use two of these – email and chat
bodyText ||| transcripts. The outcome of these providers is only visible
bodyText ||| to the owner, visualizing an egocentric map of connections,
bodyText ||| but not revealing any private information to others.
bodyText ||| For the email information, our client requests the user’s
bodyText ||| password and then crawls the mailbox and collects details
bodyText ||| of people the user corresponds with. The chat information is
bodyText ||| easily accessible to our SONAR client, as the client is
bodyText ||| implemented as a plugin of Lotus Sametime, IBM’s chat
bodyText ||| system. We extract social information from the history of
bodyText ||| chat transcripts, as these indicate the people a person
bodyText ||| actually chats with.
subsectionHeader ||| SONAR Usage Scenarios
bodyText ||| To demonstrate the potential usage of the SONAR API, we
bodyText ||| created SonarBuddies – a plugin for Lotus Sametime. The
bodyText ||| plugin presents an alternative buddylist, which consists of
bodyText ||| the people most strongly related to the user, ordered by
bodyText ||| their strength of connection (see Figure 1(a)).
bodyText ||| Additional features include showing related people to any
bodyText ||| buddy on the list, the connection points (evidence) with a
bodyText ||| buddy (Figure 1(b)), and people who are connected to both
bodyText ||| the user and a buddy (Figure 1(c)).
bodyText ||| The SonarBuddies extension has a preference page in which
bodyText ||| the user may choose the relative weight of each data source,
bodyText ||| the number of buddies to display, and the number of days in
bodyText ||| history to consider. When adjusting the preferences, the
bodyText ||| user may see a preview of the buddylist. This enables fine-
bodyText ||| tuning the selection of weights (see Figure 2).

note ||| CHI 2008 Proceedings · Online Social Networks	April 5-10, 2008 · Florence, Italy
figureCaption ||| Figure 1. SONARBuddies UI
bodyText ||| SonarBuddies is just one example of a potential SONAR
bodyText ||| client. Below, are a few examples of more advanced
bodyText ||| scenarios that SONAR may support:
listItem ||| •	Expertise location (e.g., [14,18,31]) – SONAR, integrated
listItem ||| with search, may be used for scenarios of expertise location,
listItem ||| such as the basic “who knows about <topic>?”, but also
listItem ||| “who do I know that knows about <topic>?”, and the related
listItem ||| “who do I mostly communicate with about <topic>?”
listItem ||| •	Automatic completion of names (e.g., [21]) and groups–
listItem ||| completing a single string to a name may sort alternatives by
listItem ||| strength of social ties and relevance to the context. Moreover,
listItem ||| the completion of a whole group can be supported - e.g., if
listItem ||| one participates in a project of 10 people, typing the names of
listItem ||| 3 of them may automatically be completed to the entire
listItem ||| group. This may also be useful for resolving “who's missing
listItem ||| from the mail I’m about to send?”
listItem ||| •	Finding social paths to someone who is not directly related
listItem ||| to the user (e.g., [15])
listItem ||| •	Enhancing SN services by recommending people to connect
listItem ||| to based on other evidence and by enriching information
listItem ||| about existing friends: connection strength, evidence, and
listItem ||| temporal characteristics of relationships
sectionHeader ||| SONAR EXPERIMENTS
bodyText ||| SonarBuddies has been made available for download at the
bodyText ||| IBM intranet and over 1800 users downloaded and used it.
bodyText ||| SonarBuddies is mainly an egocentric application and it
bodyText ||| could be assumed that its success is due to heavy usage of
bodyText ||| private data sources by the users. However, from the usage
bodyText ||| data it is evident that public sources are explored. We
bodyText ||| envision the SONAR API as being heavily used by
bodyText ||| sociocentric applications and thus the interest in public data
bodyText ||| sources was encouraging.
bodyText ||| This section states our hypotheses, describes our
bodyText ||| experiments, and discusses the results.
subsectionHeader ||| Hypotheses
subsubsectionHeader ||| Public Data Sources
bodyText ||| The first group of hypotheses focuses on public data
bodyText ||| sources and their influence on the users’ SN. Public data
bodyText ||| sources are different in nature, ranging from social
bodyText ||| bookmarking systems to blogs and therefore we assume:
listItem ||| (1) Public data sources provide diverse SN information.
bodyText ||| There is no single public data source that holds all SN
bodyText ||| information, and each public source makes a
bodyText ||| significant contribution to the overall SN information.
bodyText ||| Moreover, as part of the user activities are performed
bodyText ||| “outside the mailbox”, the public sources provide valuable
bodyText ||| SN information which is not reflected in private sources.
bodyText ||| We thus raise the following 2 hypotheses:
listItem ||| (2) Public data sources provide SN information that is
listItem ||| valuable to the user.
listItem ||| (3) Public data sources enrich egocentric SN information.
listItem ||| By combining private sources with public sources, one
listItem ||| can potentially get a more complete picture of the SN.
subsubsectionHeader ||| Data Source Aggregation
bodyText ||| An additional hypothesis focuses on aggregation of SN
bodyText ||| information. A key concept behind SONAR is the ability to
bodyText ||| consolidate social information from multiple data sources,
bodyText ||| assuming that there is real value in such aggregation. The
bodyText ||| following hypothesis is explored:
listItem ||| (4) Aggregated SN information is of greater value to users
listItem ||| than information that originates from any single source.
bodyText ||| A SONAR client based on this hypothesis would need to
bodyText ||| use some weight combination in order to aggregate the
bodyText ||| different sources. While the user may have control over the
bodyText ||| weights, a SONAR client should have a default weight
bodyText ||| combination that would be reasonably good for all users for
bodyText ||| the most common scenario (such as finding the people the
bodyText ||| user communicates with the most). During our experiments,
bodyText ||| we wish to study the following hypothesis:
listItem ||| (5) For a basic scenario, there exists a weighting scheme
listItem ||| by which an aggregation of data sources most
listItem ||| reasonably represents most users’ SN.
bodyText ||| If this hypothesis is correct, our experiments may reveal the
bodyText ||| weighting scheme that we should use as default.
bodyText ||| Finally, an even more valuable aggregation of SNs can be
bodyText ||| achieved if users would share some of their private SN with
bodyText ||| others. While people are hesitant to share their private
bodyText ||| information, they may agree to share the buddylists created
bodyText ||| based on it, and thus allow a sociocentric view that is
bodyText ||| enhanced by private information. We hypothesize:
listItem ||| (6) People would be willing to share the buddylists created
listItem ||| based on their private sources
subsectionHeader ||| Research Method
bodyText ||| In order to examine our hypotheses, we conducted three
bodyText ||| experiments on SN information collected by SONAR.
subsubsectionHeader ||| Experiment 1: Information from Public Sources
bodyText ||| For the first experiment we gathered information from the
bodyText ||| four public sources. Our goal was to compare the lists of
bodyText ||| connected people from the different sources (hypothesis
bodyText ||| (1)) and show that no source covers the others and may thus
bodyText ||| serve as a single source of information (hypothesis (4)). The
bodyText ||| collaboration tools in IBM, like many Web 2.0 services on
page ||| 1021
note ||| CHI 2008 Proceedings · Online Social Networks	April 5-10, 2008 · Florence, Italy
bodyText ||| the internet, are still in their diffusion phase and are not yet
bodyText ||| used by all. However, they are gaining momentum and have
bodyText ||| become quite prevalent. As we wanted to compare all
bodyText ||| sources, we decided to focus on users who use all of the
bodyText ||| chosen data sources. While such users are not a statistical
bodyText ||| sample, we refer to them as the early adopters of the
bodyText ||| technologies, and use their figures as a reflection of the
bodyText ||| potential of SN information that may be extracted from
bodyText ||| public sources as Web 2.0 technologies become ubiquitous
bodyText ||| [24].
bodyText ||| We started by locating the top 1000 heavy users of each of
bodyText ||| the tools (BlogCentral, Fringe, and Dogear). For blogs, we
bodyText ||| defined heavy users as those who received most comments
bodyText ||| in their blog. For Fringe we took the 1000 users with the
bodyText ||| largest lists of connections. For Dogear, the 1000 people
bodyText ||| with most bookmarks. Once we had these three lists, we
bodyText ||| took their union and received a list of 1761 users. We then
bodyText ||| obtained results from the different SONAR providers for all
bodyText ||| 1761 users, and examined those users who had a nonempty
bodyText ||| result in all four sources (the fourth source being the
bodyText ||| organizational chart). We ended up with a list of 273 such
bodyText ||| users. For every one of the four public sources and every
bodyText ||| one of the 273 users, we calculated the number of unique
bodyText ||| contributions of this source over the union of all other three
bodyText ||| sources.
subsubsectionHeader ||| Experiment 2: Online Questionnaire for Ranking Buddylists
bodyText ||| For the second experiment we implemented a dedicated
bodyText ||| plugin for Lotus Sametime. The plugin was easy to install
bodyText ||| and presented a questionnaire containing three sets of up to
bodyText ||| eight buddylists that were aggregated from the different
bodyText ||| sources and tailored specifically for the user. The user could
bodyText ||| not tell what the sources of the different lists had been.
bodyText ||| Before starting the experiment, we asked the user to
bodyText ||| imagine setting up an “ideal” buddylist for communication
bodyText ||| inside IBM. By this request, we framed the experiment to a
bodyText ||| basic scenario. The user was then asked to rank the
bodyText ||| buddylists by how close they were to representing the ideal
bodyText ||| buddylist. The scale for ranking was 1-4 (where “1” is
bodyText ||| good, and “4” is bad). In addition, we asked the user to
bodyText ||| mark a single buddylist as the “best” buddylist – relative to
bodyText ||| the other lists in that set.
bodyText ||| The first set of up to eight buddylists was composed solely
bodyText ||| from public sources. Our goal with this set was to examine
bodyText ||| the value of extracting SN information from public sources
bodyText ||| (hypothesis (2)), and to compare the quality of lists created
bodyText ||| by aggregation of different sources vs. the quality of lists
bodyText ||| created from a single source. The weight combinations of
bodyText ||| sources used in this set are displayed in the leftmost
bodyText ||| columns of Table 2 (1-8). We use the term “up to eight
bodyText ||| lists”, since if two different combinations created two
bodyText ||| identical lists (in both content and order), we only presented
bodyText ||| them once. If the user voted “best” for a list that was
bodyText ||| created from more than one combination, we added a vote
bodyText ||| to all these combinations.
bodyText ||| The second set of buddylists was also focused on public
bodyText ||| sources. The goal with this set was to learn whether a
bodyText ||| specific weight combination is preferred by most users and
bodyText ||| may serve as a default (hypothesis (5)). The weight
bodyText ||| combinations of sources used in this set are displayed in the
bodyText ||| rightmost columns of Table 2 (9-16).
bodyText ||| The last set of buddylists introduced information gathered
bodyText ||| from the user’s private sources. The goal of this set was to
bodyText ||| examine the value of information public sources add over
bodyText ||| private sources (hypothesis (3)), as well as to study the
bodyText ||| effect aggregation has on the lists (hypothesis (4)) –
bodyText ||| aggregation of private sources, and aggregation of a mix of
bodyText ||| private and public sources. The weight combinations of
bodyText ||| sources used in this set are displayed in Table 5 (17-24).
bodyText ||| Our plugin reported the user ranking of the buddylists to a
bodyText ||| dedicated server that produced a report with all results. The
bodyText ||| results visible to us did not contain any private information
bodyText ||| nor could we see the buddylists, we only examined the
bodyText ||| ranks (1-4) and the vote for best list in each set.
subsubsectionHeader ||| Experiment 3: Sliders UI for Personal Weight Combination
bodyText ||| A set of interviews we conducted, helped us examine
bodyText ||| hypotheses (2), (4), and (6), as well as hypothesis (5). It
bodyText ||| also gave us some insight about how people perceive their
bodyText ||| SN and what they feel about our UI.
bodyText ||| The preferences-page of the SONAR plugin allows
bodyText ||| modifying the weight combination of different sources with
bodyText ||| sliders and simultaneously seeing a preview of the buddylist
bodyText ||| created from this combination. The user interface of this
bodyText ||| feature is shown in Figure 2.

figureCaption ||| Figure 2. Weight combination user interface
bodyText ||| We conducted personal interviews with 12 of the users who
bodyText ||| took part in experiment 2, in order to learn about their
bodyText ||| experience with the sliders and follow their line of thought
bodyText ||| while they are examining the different buddylists. Each
bodyText ||| interviewee was asked to first reset all sliders and start with
bodyText ||| an empty list. In order to examine hypotheses (2) and (4),
bodyText ||| each slider was moved separately, to compare the lists
bodyText ||| based on single sources to an ideal list (as in the framed
bodyText ||| scenario of experiment 2). Once all sources were examined,
bodyText ||| the interviewees were asked to fiddle with the sliders in
bodyText ||| order to compose a list that is closest to their ideal list. We
bodyText ||| retrieved the selected weight combinations from our logs
bodyText ||| and examined them in order to validate hypothesis (5).
bodyText ||| Finally, we posed the question about sharing the buddylists
bodyText ||| based on private sources (hypothesis (6)). The question is a
bodyText ||| multiple choice question: to share automatically vs. share
bodyText ||| after manual editing; to share with anyone, or only with
bodyText ||| friends, or only with a specific individual.
subsectionHeader ||| Experimental Results
subsubsectionHeader ||| Results of Experiment 1
bodyText ||| In this experiment we examined the 273 users who had a
bodyText ||| nonempty result in all four public sources. For each of the
bodyText ||| four public sources and each of the 273 users, we calculated
bodyText ||| the number of connections extracted from the source, and
bodyText ||| the number of unique contributions of this source over the
bodyText ||| union of all other three sources. The averages of these
bodyText ||| figures appear in Table 3.
bodyText ||| Examining the average numbers of unique contributions is
bodyText ||| interesting. One would assume that the commonalities of
bodyText ||| the lists from the different sources would be large; that a
bodyText ||| person would mostly friend with peers from the
bodyText ||| organizational group; that a person’s friends would be the
bodyText ||| ones commenting in the blogging system; and even that
bodyText ||| working in the same group would imply similar interests
bodyText ||| and thus bookmarking the same web pages. However, our

table ||| 	(4.0%)		(13.6/0)	(0.0%)
tableCaption ||| Table 4. Unique contribution over all other sources
bodyText ||| results reveal a different picture. It seems that for each and
bodyText ||| every source, the average number of unique contributions
bodyText ||| over the other three sources is quite close to the average
bodyText ||| number of connections, implying that the information
bodyText ||| extracted from the different sources is indeed diverse.
bodyText ||| Table 4 shows two statistics of the unique contributions of
bodyText ||| the different sources over all other sources. The first row in
bodyText ||| the table shows the number of people for whom the source
bodyText ||| contributed its full list – meaning that the lists from other
bodyText ||| sources had no intersection with this source. For instance,
bodyText ||| for 107 of the people (39.19%) – the lists of blog
bodyText ||| commenters, tagging friends, or similar bookmarkers did
bodyText ||| not contain anyone from their organizational group. As can
bodyText ||| be seen on Table 4, these numbers are rather large – 76 for
bodyText ||| Fringe, 83 for BlogCentral, and 55 for Dogear – indicating
bodyText ||| the diversity of the sources. There was not even a single
bodyText ||| person, for whom a single source covered all other sources,
bodyText ||| proving that aggregation creates a broader picture than any
bodyText ||| single source. The second row in the table shows the
bodyText ||| number of people for whom a source contributed nothing
bodyText ||| over the other lists. These figures indicate cases in which a
bodyText ||| single source may be dismissed, as the other three sources
bodyText ||| cover the information it provides. As may be seen on the
bodyText ||| table, these figures are rather small: up to 37, for
bodyText ||| BlogCentral, and as low as 0 for Dogear.
bodyText ||| For 33 out of the 273 people examined (12.08%), there was
bodyText ||| no intersection between any of the sources – each of their
bodyText ||| public sources provided a completely different list.
bodyText ||| The results of this experiment validate hypothesis (1) and
bodyText ||| support hypothesis (4), showing the diversity of information
bodyText ||| from public sources, that no single source holds all SN
bodyText ||| information, and thus that aggregation is likely to be of
bodyText ||| greater value than information from any single source.
subsubsectionHeader ||| Results of Experiments 2 and 3
bodyText ||| Our questionnaire plugin collected information from 116
bodyText ||| users who responded to all three stages of the experiment.
bodyText ||| Out of the 116 users, 65 are from the US and Canada, 49
bodyText ||| are from Europe and the Middle East, and two are from
bodyText ||| Asia Pacific. 73 of the users who responded are using
bodyText ||| Fringe, 29 are bloggers, and 62 use Dogear. We believe
bodyText ||| these users represent a wide range of IBM employees and
bodyText ||| are thus a good test bed for our hypotheses. In addition,
bodyText ||| results collected from the in depth interviews with 12 users
bodyText ||| strengthen some of our hypotheses.
bodyText ||| The bottom part of Table 2 shows the results of the first two
bodyText ||| sets of buddylists. On the first step, shown on the bottom
bodyText ||| left of the table, the list that got the most “best” votes (63)
bodyText ||| is the one based on a single source: the organizational chart.
page ||| 1023
note ||| CHI 2008 Proceedings · Online Social Networks	April 5-10, 2008 · Florence, Italy
bodyText ||| The average score of this list is 2.36 (on a scale of 1=good,
bodyText ||| 4=bad). The list that got the best average score is the one
bodyText ||| based on aggregation of all four sources by weight
bodyText ||| combination 7 on Table 2. The average score of this list is
bodyText ||| 2.34 and its number of “best” votes is 58. Over 40% of the
bodyText ||| users (48) got in this aggregated list an identical list to the
bodyText ||| one based on the organizational chart. As the score of the
bodyText ||| aggregated list is better, we may conclude that when the
bodyText ||| lists were not identical, the aggregated list received better
bodyText ||| scores. Finally, note that in Table 2, the total number of
bodyText ||| “best” votes given to aggregations (i.e., combinations 5
bodyText ||| through 8) was significantly higher than the combined
bodyText ||| number of “best” votes for all single sources (1 through 4).
bodyText ||| We consider the above findings as supporting hypothesis
bodyText ||| (4) – the value of aggregation.
bodyText ||| The results of the second step are shown on the bottom
bodyText ||| right of Table 2. All lists of this step received scores that
bodyText ||| are higher than 2 but lower than 3, and all lists received
bodyText ||| quite a few “best” votes (over 40). It appears that no
bodyText ||| optimal weighting scheme exists that may serve a good
bodyText ||| default for most users. We were therefore unable to prove
bodyText ||| our hypothesis (5). While conducting the interviews during
bodyText ||| experiment 3, we had another chance to see how different
bodyText ||| people prefer different sources. For example, when
bodyText ||| examining the list from Fringe, one of the users said:
bodyText ||| “Completely off. Only 7 people, out of them only 3 are
bodyText ||| familiar” while another said: “Accurate, very accurate
bodyText ||| actually. [ ...] that would be my ideal buddylist”.
bodyText ||| The results of the third step are shown on the bottom of
bodyText ||| Table 5. In this step we compared lists from private sources
bodyText ||| with lists from public sources and with lists based on a mix
bodyText ||| of private and public sources. For this step our plugin
bodyText ||| requested access to users’ private data. Only 55 users
bodyText ||| granted us access to their private data. We therefore based
bodyText ||| our analysis on the responses of these 55 users only.
bodyText ||| As can be expected, the lists based on private sources
bodyText ||| received better average scores (1.62-1.76) than those based
bodyText ||| solely on public sources. The list with most “best” votes
bodyText ||| (17) on is the list based on the (private) chat system.

tableCaption ||| Table 5. Weight combinations and results of public and
tableCaption ||| private sources in the third set of buddylists
bodyText ||| However, 17 votes are only 30.9%, indicating that no list
bodyText ||| significantly outvoted the others. The list with best average
bodyText ||| score (1.62) is the list based on combination 18 in Table 5
bodyText ||| (email and chat), supporting the value of aggregating
bodyText ||| information (private in this case) – hypothesis (4). Yet
bodyText ||| another supporting point for hypothesis (4) was received
bodyText ||| during the interviews, when no single user had chosen a list
bodyText ||| based solely on one source. This observation is less strong,
bodyText ||| since the experiment setting encouraged people to play with
bodyText ||| aggregations, yet they clearly had a choice to disable all
bodyText ||| other sources and stay with one, but did not.
bodyText ||| Table 2 and Table 5 also show the number of times each of
bodyText ||| the buddylists in this experiment received score 1. List 18
bodyText ||| (email and chat) received score 1 for the largest number of
bodyText ||| times – over 54% of the people granted it a perfect score.
bodyText ||| Other lists which obtained many high scores are list 20 (mix
bodyText ||| of public and private), list 22 (email), list 23 (chat), and list
bodyText ||| 24 (anther mix of public and private). It is obvious from the
bodyText ||| table that lists based on private sources receive score 1
bodyText ||| more often, as expected. The value of public sources is
bodyText ||| evident from the bottom line of Table 2: the lists based
bodyText ||| solely on public sources received a perfect score a
bodyText ||| considerable amount of times, supporting hypothesis (2). In
bodyText ||| experiment 3, seven of 11 used some combination of public
bodyText ||| and private data sources (the twelfth user had no access to
bodyText ||| private data) and two of them even preferred the public
bodyText ||| sources slightly over private ones (see Table 6).
bodyText ||| Two of the combinations that mixed all six sources (number
bodyText ||| 20 and number 24 in Table 5) received 9 “best” votes each.
bodyText ||| Examining our results reveals that each such vote was given
bodyText ||| by a different user, implying that for 18 people, they created
bodyText ||| a buddylist that is preferred over the buddylists based solely
bodyText ||| on private sources. Both these lists received an average
bodyText ||| score of 1.75, which is identical to the average score of the
bodyText ||| list based on chat, and they both received a perfect score 23
bodyText ||| times. This implies that for quite a few people the mix with
bodyText ||| public sources creates buddylists of high quality. Together
bodyText ||| with the fact that in experiment 3 most users chose to
bodyText ||| combine private with public data, we conclude that
bodyText ||| hypothesis (3) is true - information from public sources
bodyText ||| may provide a more complete picture of one’s SN.
bodyText ||| Finally, Experiment 3 revealed what people think about
bodyText ||| sharing lists coming from their private data sources (see
bodyText ||| Table 6). Most of the people (10) said that they will be
table ||| 	1	2	3	4	5	6	7	8	9	10	11	12

note ||| CHI 2008 Proceedings · Online Social Networks	April 5-10, 2008 · Florence, Italy
bodyText ||| willing to share their lists with anyone. Seven stated that
bodyText ||| they would want to edit first. “I am worried that SONAR
bodyText ||| results are not accurate enough and would like to [ ...]
bodyText ||| make sure the people who see the lists get good lists”, said
bodyText ||| one user. Another user said, at first, “[I am] worried about
bodyText ||| what my buddies would say about me sharing their names”,
bodyText ||| but, after thinking about it he decided that it was harmless
bodyText ||| enough and said he would share his lists. Four users showed
bodyText ||| great openness by declaring that they would share their list
bodyText ||| automatically, without any editing, with anyone. Only one
bodyText ||| user said that he will not share his lists with anyone. One of
bodyText ||| the users summarized these results nicely: “... I think it
bodyText ||| should always be left up to the individual as there are
bodyText ||| dangerous things about SN. [but]... within a company, you
bodyText ||| have to realize you are probably not going to be that
bodyText ||| private”. All in all, hypothesis (6) is supported to a high
bodyText ||| extent. Our results suggest that there is a good chance
bodyText ||| people will be willing to share their private-based
bodyText ||| buddylists after applying some editing to it.
subsubsectionHeader ||| Discussion
bodyText ||| Our experiments show that information from public sources
bodyText ||| is very diverse and no single source may provide all SN
bodyText ||| information. While some sources provide communication
bodyText ||| data, others provide similarity data. While reacting to lists
bodyText ||| generated from Dogear, users said: “Far from ideal list”,
bodyText ||| “Over 50% are strangers”. But another user, while
bodyText ||| discussing her usage of SNs described: “if my goal was to
bodyText ||| search for expertise, then I would lean it heavily towards
bodyText ||| social bookmarking and blogs”. It suggests that diverse
bodyText ||| sources can become valuable for diverse tasks. It also
bodyText ||| explains why our hope to locate an optimal default
bodyText ||| combination of weights for aggregation was not fulfilled -
bodyText ||| different users with different views and different needs may
bodyText ||| require different combinations of the sources.
bodyText ||| The information extracted from public sources is shown to
bodyText ||| be of value, and while private sources provide better
bodyText ||| information, public sources do contribute additional
bodyText ||| information and create a more complete picture of SNs. The
bodyText ||| value of aggregation is proven both by the diversity of
bodyText ||| public sources and by user votes for aggregated lists.
bodyText ||| We saw in our interviews that aggregation and collection of
bodyText ||| SN information becomes crucial in global organizations.
bodyText ||| While analyzing the organizational chart data source one of
bodyText ||| the users noted: “It just looks at people within my world,
bodyText ||| and I deal with a lot of people outside of my function, if you
bodyText ||| will”. Another user commented: “Names that were missing
bodyText ||| on email appear now. Top person on ideal list does not
bodyText ||| appear here”. It shows that no single data source is
bodyText ||| sufficient for creating one’s ideal buddylist and thus
bodyText ||| demonstrates the value of aggregation.
sectionHeader ||| CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK
bodyText ||| In this paper, we present the motivation and challenge for
bodyText ||| aggregating SN information from multiple data sources. We
bodyText ||| describe SONAR, an API for exposing relations embedded
bodyText ||| in numerous applications or services. SONAR allows
bodyText ||| building weighted networks with evidence for each
bodyText ||| connection, showing how strongly people are connected.
bodyText ||| SONAR was implemented for various sources, public and
bodyText ||| personal, within IBM, and demonstrated through a plugin
bodyText ||| for Lotus Sametime: SONARBuddies.
bodyText ||| Our experiments indicate that aggregation produces a more
bodyText ||| comprehensive SN. Information coming from public data
bodyText ||| sources is shown to be relevant and diverse. Public sources
bodyText ||| mainly represent new emerging social technologies on the
bodyText ||| Web. We believe that people’s involvement in these
bodyText ||| technologies will continue to grow, while new technologies
bodyText ||| appear. Hence, more quality social information will be
bodyText ||| available for frameworks like SONAR. For some users,
bodyText ||| public sources make a significant contribution over private
bodyText ||| ones, which may have been considered the predominant
bodyText ||| sources. It is extremely interesting to continue examining
bodyText ||| the potential of public sources to actually replace SN
bodyText ||| information currently extracted from private sources, and
bodyText ||| thus relieving privacy issues.
bodyText ||| This paper focuses on general SNs. In practice, there are
bodyText ||| different types of SNs, which reflect different semantics of
bodyText ||| connections, like friendship, interpersonal communication,
bodyText ||| or similarity. Such networks tend to be semantically
bodyText ||| different even for the same user. Shared bookmarks, for
bodyText ||| instance, reflect similarity between users rather than a direct
bodyText ||| connection. The scenario used in our experiments asked the
bodyText ||| users to rank buddylists, typically used for communication.
bodyText ||| It was natural that Dogear, which exposes similarity,
bodyText ||| received low scores by our users. One could think of
bodyText ||| different scenarios, such as finding potential people for a
bodyText ||| community on a specific topic, where this similarity
bodyText ||| network would be a perfect networking tool. It would be
bodyText ||| interesting to identify different scenarios and examine the
bodyText ||| contribution of different sources to them.
bodyText ||| Another interesting direction is deriving contextual
bodyText ||| networks – networks that are related to a specific context or
bodyText ||| term. For example, the list of people with whom one
bodyText ||| communicates most frequently about Java, is likely to be
bodyText ||| different from the list of people with whom one
bodyText ||| communicates mostly about SN analysis.
bodyText ||| Our plans for future work on the SONAR API include
bodyText ||| extending it to support different types of relations (e.g.,
bodyText ||| familiarity vs. similarity). We also plan to allow a
bodyText ||| specification of a search term to support contextual queries
bodyText ||| such as: “who is most related to <person> w.r.t. <topic>?”
bodyText ||| These extensions would allow us to further explore the
bodyText ||| variety of SNs, the differences and relations among them,
bodyText ||| the value they bring to users, and the patterns of their usage.
