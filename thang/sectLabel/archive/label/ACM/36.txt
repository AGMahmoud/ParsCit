sectionHeader ||| ABSTRACT
bodyText ||| A neural network based clustering method for the analysis
bodyText ||| of soft handovers in 3G network is introduced. The method
bodyText ||| is highly visual and it could be utilized in explorative anal-
bodyText ||| ysis of mobile networks. In this paper, the method is used
bodyText ||| to find groups of similar mobile cell pairs in the sense of
bodyText ||| handover measurements. The groups or clusters found by
bodyText ||| the method are characterized by the rate of successful han-
bodyText ||| dovers as well as the causes of failing handover attempts.
bodyText ||| The most interesting clusters are those which represent cer-
bodyText ||| tain type of problems in handover attempts. By comparing
bodyText ||| variable histograms of a selected cluster to histograms of
bodyText ||| the whole data set an application domain expert may find
bodyText ||| some explanations on problems. Two clusters are investi-
bodyText ||| gated further and causes of failing handover attempts are
bodyText ||| discussed.

bodyText ||| Mobility management is a great challenge in current and
bodyText ||| future radio access networks. In third generation (3G) net-
bodyText ||| works user experienced quality of service (QoS) under a
bodyText ||| move of mobile station (MS) from one mobile cell to an-
bodyText ||| other cell has been improved by implementing soft handover

bodyText ||| (SHO). Soft handover makes it possible to have connections
bodyText ||| on several base stations (BS) simultaneously.
bodyText ||| In this paper, a set of measurements which can be used for
bodyText ||| soft handover decision making are analyzed and compared
bodyText ||| with other measurements in which statistics of successful-
bodyText ||| ness of handover attempts have been collected. We do not
bodyText ||| know exactly the parameters of used SHO algorithm. SHOs
bodyText ||| are investigated only on basis of data set and some general
bodyText ||| knowledge of 3G systems. Mobile cell pairs with handovers
bodyText ||| (HO) are divided in groups using clustering algorithm. Cell
bodyText ||| pairs in which SHOs are similar with each other fall in same
bodyText ||| group. Different types of SHO failures are analyzed using
bodyText ||| clustering information and distributions of measurements in
bodyText ||| each cluster.
bodyText ||| In Section 2 the soft handover concept, the measurements
bodyText ||| and used neural network algorithm are shortly introduced.
bodyText ||| Analysis methods which have been used are described in
bodyText ||| Section 3. Preliminary results are shown and discussed in
bodyText ||| Section 4. Finally, some conclusions are drawn in the last
bodyText ||| section.
sectionHeader ||| 2. BACKGROUND
bodyText ||| In this section, the basics of soft handover in 3G network
bodyText ||| is explained and the available data set is introduced. Neural
bodyText ||| network algorithm used in data clustering is also presented.
subsectionHeader ||| 2.1 Soft handover
bodyText ||| Soft handover is a state of MS being connected to several
bodyText ||| BSs simultaneously. In GSM networks, a fixed threshold for
bodyText ||| handover from one cell to another is used. In 3G networks,
bodyText ||| each MS is connected to a network via a set of BSs called
bodyText ||| active set. Members of active set are updated on basis of
bodyText ||| measurements made by MS. The advantage of having con-
bodyText ||| nections on several BS simultaneously is realized when MS
bodyText ||| is moving towards another BS, the MS should have a con-
bodyText ||| nection at least on one BS all the time. In GSM system, the
bodyText ||| older connection has to be terminated before the new one
bodyText ||| can be setup. The connection setup phases are the most
bodyText ||| vulnerable steps in a call. The connection between MS and
bodyText ||| BS is setup in a beginning of a call or later when handover
bodyText ||| occurs. If the setup is not successful, it is useful to have an
bodyText ||| existing connection to another BS or otherwise the call will
bodyText ||| be abnormally terminated.
bodyText ||| Handover can occur due to signal quality reasons or when
bodyText ||| the traffic capacity in a cell has reached its maximum or is
bodyText ||| approaching it. In the latter case, traffic load in the network
bodyText ||| can be distributed more uniformly by handing over some
bodyText ||| users from the most crowded cells. The above method is
page ||| 330
bodyText ||| called cell breathing. Use of cell breathing without giving
bodyText ||| the information to the analyzer increases the complexity of
bodyText ||| the analysis and can mix up a lot in the analysis process.
bodyText ||| For a user soft handover means power saving (in uplink)
bodyText ||| and less abnormally terminated calls. For an operator lower
bodyText ||| MS transmitting powers mean less interference. When MS
bodyText ||| is in SHO, several BSs listen the same uplink channel, but
bodyText ||| all BSs have their own downlink channel. The offered diver-
bodyText ||| sity is resource consuming in downlink direction. There is
bodyText ||| a tradeoff between better QoS in mobility management and
bodyText ||| consumption of resources.
bodyText ||| Decision of soft handover is made in mobile station by
bodyText ||| comparing the signal-to-noise ratios of active and candidate
bodyText ||| BSs Common Pilot Channel (CPICH) [2]. Members of ac-
bodyText ||| tive set are selected on basis of powers of this pilot signal [5,
bodyText ||| 12, 16] .
bodyText ||| BSs which are not in the active set but next from it in the
bodyText ||| sense of measured quantity are in candidate set. Candidate
bodyText ||| set BSs are constantly monitored whether their offer better
bodyText ||| connection than cells in active set. Cells not in active or
bodyText ||| candidate set are monitored less frequently whether their
bodyText ||| can enter the candidate set. Cell is either added to the
bodyText ||| active set if the maximum amount of cells in the active set
bodyText ||| is not reached or cell replaces the cell which offers the lowest
bodyText ||| quality connection. Cells which are no more able to offer
bodyText ||| a connection which is good enough are removed from the
bodyText ||| active set.
bodyText ||| Thresholds are used in adding, replacing and removing
bodyText ||| BSs from active set by BSs in candidate set to avoid ping
bodyText ||| pong effect. This means that a value of measured quantity
bodyText ||| should be with a certain threshold better than the old one
bodyText ||| for changing cells in active set. If measurement which is only
bodyText ||| slightly better (i.e. with zero threshold) is enough for chang-
bodyText ||| ing cells in sets, it is quite possible that the same change is
bodyText ||| performed in opposite direction very soon. Thus, the origi-
bodyText ||| nal update of the set was useless and resource consuming in
bodyText ||| the sense of all required signaling.
subsectionHeader ||| 2.2 Data
bodyText ||| Three data sets of Key Performance Indicator (KPI) level
bodyText ||| measurements related on handover events are saved. Each
bodyText ||| set consists of measurements collected during one hour. KPI
bodyText ||| is considered as an important measure to be followed. It can
bodyText ||| be a measurement by itself or it has been computed from a
bodyText ||| group of raw counters [10]. One data vector consists of prob-
bodyText ||| abilities, means, sums and counters computed over one hour
bodyText ||| of one source target cell pair. Here, source refers on cell
bodyText ||| in active set and target on another cell which is measured
bodyText ||| and possibly added in active or candidate set. Measure-
bodyText ||| ments of target cell are compared with those of source cell.
bodyText ||| Handover decisions are made in MS on basis of measured
bodyText ||| and computed base stations received signal signal-to-noise
bodyText ||| ratios (Ec/N0). For each source and target cell pair mean
bodyText ||| of signal-to-noise ratio differences is computed using
equation ||| EcnoDiffMean = mean {[Ec/N0]target — [Ec/N0] source}
bodyText ||| Mean value and number off made comparisons (EcnoDiffNum)
bodyText ||| are saved. Four bin pdfs of these measurements are also
bodyText ||| stored with bin centers in -6, -3, 0 and 3dB, correspond-
bodyText ||| ingly.
bodyText ||| In addition to Ec/N0 measurements, averages of received
bodyText ||| pilot signal power ratios between BS pairs (av rscp ratio)
bodyText ||| have been computed and stored in database. The time and
bodyText ||| probability of being in SHO with each other have also been
bodyText ||| measured. Time of target and source cell being in SHO with
bodyText ||| each other simultaneously is counted in variable t act. Then,
bodyText ||| at least one MS is in SHO having both source and target cell
bodyText ||| in its active set. The measurement is symmetric for a switch
bodyText ||| of source and target cells. Time of target cell being in SHO
bodyText ||| with source cell is stored in t act dir. Cell total time in
bodyText ||| SHO is saved in tot time sho. It has been counted over all
bodyText ||| the targets of fixed source cell. Probability of target and
bodyText ||| source being in same active set is stored in variable p act.
bodyText ||| Total number of SHO attempts to add target to active
bodyText ||| set is stored in SHO total att. Ratio of successful SHO at-
bodyText ||| tempts which lead to addition of target cell in active set is
bodyText ||| saved in add ratio. In addition to those above, the num-
bodyText ||| ber of SHO failures is stored in pfail total and ratios of four
bodyText ||| different failure causes are saved. Failure occurs in setup
bodyText ||| or active time phase of SHO and it is either radio channel
bodyText ||| problem or not. Probability of cell being in monitored state
bodyText ||| is also measured (p4th 5th). All the measurements used in
bodyText ||| the analysis are shortly described in Table 1.
bodyText ||| A lot of data has been saved in data sets, but also some
bodyText ||| very important information is missing. Due to missing in-
bodyText ||| formation on cell capacities, their locations and performed
bodyText ||| manual and automatic tuning operations on network config-
bodyText ||| uration between successive data set saves, only preliminary
bodyText ||| analysis can be performed. The rest of the analysis process
bodyText ||| is described on theoretical level.
subsectionHeader ||| 2.3 Self-Organizing Map
bodyText ||| Self-Organizing Map (SOM) [8] is an unsupervised neu-
bodyText ||| ral network algorithm which adapts the codebook vectors
bodyText ||| of neurons so that they approximate the input data distri-
bodyText ||| bution. When the training has converged topological areas
bodyText ||| or domains corresponding to certain types of inputs can be
bodyText ||| found from the map. The topology and the size of the net-
bodyText ||| work is fixed before adaptation.
bodyText ||| In the SOM algorithm, the codebook vectors wj of the
bodyText ||| SOM are at first initialized. Then, the following steps are
bodyText ||| repeated for each input vector x: Find the index of best-
bodyText ||| matching or nearest codebook vector using
equation ||| i(x) = argminI Ix — wj I I,
bodyText ||| in which j goes through all the neurons in the map. Next,
bodyText ||| the codebook vectors of winner neuron and its neighbors are
bodyText ||| updated using
equation ||| wj (t + 1) = wj (t) + αhij (x)(x(t) — wj (t)).
bodyText ||| Here, α is the learning rate and hij (x) is the neighborhood
bodyText ||| function centered around the winner neuron. Input sample
bodyText ||| x defines the winner neuron and the topological distance
bodyText ||| between indexes i and j defines how much the neuron is
bodyText ||| updated. Neighborhood function is typically Gaussian or
bodyText ||| bubble function i.e. function which decrease monotonically
bodyText ||| and even goes to zero when the distance increases.
bodyText ||| In this paper, a batch version of the SOM algorithm is
bodyText ||| used. In batch SOM, all codebook vectors of the SOM are
bodyText ||| computed after the best-matching units of all input data
bodyText ||| vectors have been found. The same data set is used several
bodyText ||| times.

bodyText ||| study, methods presented in Figure 1 are used. At first,
bodyText ||| the miner have to decide what could be interesting in this
bodyText ||| data. The analysis task has to be defined. On basis of that
bodyText ||| the first choice of variables will be done. Next, the selected
bodyText ||| variables are preprocessed, in order to be able to use them
bodyText ||| in later analysis.
bodyText ||| In data mining tasks, variable selection and preprocessing
bodyText ||| are the most critical phases, because in this step the miner
bodyText ||| decides which variables are important and how should they
bodyText ||| be processed. The whole data mining process consists of sev-
bodyText ||| eral cycles performed repeatedly. The cycles include testing
bodyText ||| how different variable selections and preprocessing methods
bodyText ||| effect on final results. The process has inner loops in which
bodyText ||| some tasks or parameters are fixed on basis of selections
bodyText ||| made in outer loop. The inner loops are performed more
bodyText ||| frequently. Loops with more general task like the defini-
bodyText ||| tion of mining task are repeated less frequently. When the
bodyText ||| mining task is defined the analyzer should be able to decide
bodyText ||| what is (s)he looking out for.
bodyText ||| Now, the analysis task is defined as finding groups of sim-
bodyText ||| ilarly behaving cell pairs in SHO situations. Importance of
bodyText ||| measurements can also be highlighted using proper weight-
bodyText ||| ing of variables. In addition to clustering, also other tasks
bodyText ||| for data analysis can be defined. One possibility is to try to
bodyText ||| find cells or cell pairs with anomalous behavior. Anomalies
bodyText ||| can also be found by clustering, but expert knowledge in
bodyText ||| variable selection and preprocessing steps are very impor-
bodyText ||| tant.
bodyText ||| Using different variables, preprocessing methods and weight-
bodyText ||| ing of variables different clustering results can be found. To
bodyText ||| find out which of them is useful, interpretation of clusters is
bodyText ||| needed. This can be done using histograms or rules defined
bodyText ||| by data samples falling in clusters. The results which have
bodyText ||| been found using clustering methods should be visualized
bodyText ||| together with spatial locations to be able to understand the
bodyText ||| usefulness of results. Methods should be performed repeat-
bodyText ||| edly to analyze successive data sets under the knowledge of
bodyText ||| performed tuning operations. Thus, there is a possibility to
bodyText ||| find explanations to changing results. In this study, results
bodyText ||| of only one data set are shown, because more information
bodyText ||| on application domain is needed to be able to combine and
bodyText ||| compare successive clustering results.
subsectionHeader ||| 3.1 Preprocessing
bodyText ||| Different preprocessing methods have been tested. The
bodyText ||| final method was selected on basis of histograms and the
bodyText ||| clusters which were found using the selected method. At
bodyText ||| the first step, the distributions are truncated. Outliers in
bodyText ||| the selected variables were replaced by their maximum per-
bodyText ||| mitted values. Two variables, pfail total and EcnoDiffNum,
bodyText ||| were scaled using the number of performed soft handover
bodyText ||| attempts (see Table 1). Logarithms of some of the variables
bodyText ||| were taken, but finally only scaled EcnoDiffNum was prepro-
bodyText ||| cessed with logarithmic function. Sample vectors with high
bodyText ||| amount of undefined measurements were canceled. Used
bodyText ||| clustering method (see section 3.2) allows using sample vec-
bodyText ||| tors in which some variables are undefined. However, they
bodyText ||| are not so useful when the rate of undefined values increases.
bodyText ||| Here, sample vectors with 15 or more missing values in 20
bodyText ||| variables are canceled.
bodyText ||| In Figure 2 the histograms of the most interesting vari-
bodyText ||| ables preprocessed using selected methods are visualized.
bodyText ||| Some of the variables have quite high peaks in distributions,
bodyText ||| but due to the origin of variables no other preprocessing
bodyText ||| have been performed. For example, handover failure reasons
bodyText ||| pfail ini, pfail ini radio, pfail act radio and pfail act sum up
bodyText ||| to unity. However, pfail act is not analyzed because it is zero
bodyText ||| all the time in the first data set.

figureCaption ||| nected with solid arrows have been performed.
subsectionHeader ||| 3.2 Clustering
bodyText ||| Cluster analysis is used to divide data vectors in groups.
bodyText ||| Data vectors falling in same cluster are similar with each
bodyText ||| other. Here, clustering is performed using a two-phase
bodyText ||| method [15]. In this method, data vectors are at first used
bodyText ||| to train a Self-Organizing Map. Neurons of the SOM adapt
bodyText ||| to incoming data so that the input data can in later analysis
bodyText ||| be represented by the codebook vectors of neurons. Number
bodyText ||| of these codebook vectors is much smaller than the number
bodyText ||| of original data vectors. Thus, computational complexity of
bodyText ||| the final crisp clustering algorithm is decreased. Another
bodyText ||| advantage of using a SOM based two-phase method instead
bodyText ||| of direct clustering of data vectors is the visualization capa-
bodyText ||| bility of SOM.
bodyText ||| In addition to preprocessing, SOM algorithm provides an-
bodyText ||| other possibility to emphasize important properties of data.
bodyText ||| Larger weights in distance computation are given to the
bodyText ||| most important properties defined by the analyzer. Smaller
bodyText ||| or even zero weight can be given to those variables which
bodyText ||| are not used in organization of the SOM i.e. in building clus-
bodyText ||| ters. However, values of them can be compared to those with
bodyText ||| larger weights using various visualization methods. Weight-
bodyText ||| ing by variable importance can also be built into SOM train-
bodyText ||| ing algorithm by utilizing learning distance metrics [7].
figureCaption ||| Figure 2: Logarithmic histograms after distribution
figureCaption ||| cuts, logarithmic preprocessing of r EcnoDNum and
figureCaption ||| scaling of all variables between [0,1]
bodyText ||| The codebook vectors are further clustered using k-means
bodyText ||| or some hierarchical clustering method. In this paper, Ward
bodyText ||| agglomerative clustering method has been used [4]. In the
bodyText ||| beginning of hierarchical clustering, each codebook vector
bodyText ||| is a cluster of its own. In the next step, the most similar
bodyText ||| clusters are combined and this is continued until all vectors
bodyText ||| are in same cluster. The clustering results form a tree struc-
bodyText ||| ture called dendrogram. In visualization of a dendrogram,
bodyText ||| the clusters combined in each step and the distance between
bodyText ||| them are shown. Final clustering is selected by cutting this
bodyText ||| tree at certain level. The number of clusters can be selected
bodyText ||| manually or some cluster validation index can be utilized
bodyText ||| to find the optimum. In this paper, Davies-Bouldin vali-
bodyText ||| dation index has been used [3]. Similar clustering methods
bodyText ||| have earlier been used in the analysis of both GSM and 3G
bodyText ||| network BTSs [9, 11, 13].
bodyText ||| As a result of clustering, each data vector is represented
bodyText ||| by index of one neuron or by the codebook vector stored in
bodyText ||| that neuron. Furthermore, the neuron and the data vectors
bodyText ||| the neuron represents belong to same cluster. On basis of
bodyText ||| the clustering result, some clusters can be selected for more
bodyText ||| specific analysis. Cluster selection is usually done on basis
bodyText ||| of found higher values of some critical variables. It is pos-
bodyText ||| sible to build a system in which rules are found for clusters
bodyText ||| [14, 9] and these are used to select interesting clusters au-
bodyText ||| tomatically. Here, interesting clusters are selected manually
bodyText ||| on basis of clusterwise variable mean values and histograms.
sectionHeader ||| 4. RESULTS
bodyText ||| In this section, handover measurement data is used to
bodyText ||| train a Self-Organizing Map of size 17 x 12. Then, the code-
bodyText ||| book vectors of the SOM are clustered using hierarchical
bodyText ||| Ward method. Results of clustering are described and two
bodyText ||| clusters are then selected for more specific analysis. Charac-
bodyText ||| teristics of sample vectors falling in those clusters are studied
bodyText ||| using histograms.

bodyText ||| nearest neuron of input data vector. These variables have
bodyText ||| nonzero mask which can also be considered as a weighting
bodyText ||| factor in a search for the best-matching neuron. Rest of
bodyText ||| the variables have zero mask, which means that they can
bodyText ||| be visualized and updated using SOM algorithm, but they
bodyText ||| do not have an effect on organization of the SOM and on
bodyText ||| selection of the cluster in which the sample belongs to.
bodyText ||| In Figure 3 all other component planes of SOM with pos-
bodyText ||| itive mask are shown, except Ec/N0 difference distributions
bodyText ||| which are shown in Figure 6. In component plane visual-
bodyText ||| ization, distributions of components (or variables) of SOM
bodyText ||| codebook vectors are shown. Component values of one code-
bodyText ||| book vector are visualized using grayscaling and their locate
bodyText ||| in the same position at each plane. For example, values of
bodyText ||| one codebook vector are shown at upper right corner in each
bodyText ||| plane.
figureCaption ||| Figure 3: Component planes of SOM with denor-
figureCaption ||| malized scales. Shown variables have nonzero mask
figureCaption ||| and they are not describing Ec/N0 difference distri-
figureCaption ||| butions.
bodyText ||| Some component values which were not used in SOM
bodyText ||| training (i.e. they were masked out) are shown in Figure
bodyText ||| 4. Although, they have no effect on SOM organization, they
bodyText ||| are adapted to be able to compare their distributions even
bodyText ||| with those used in organizing the SOM.
bodyText ||| By visual comparison of variables in Figures 3 and 4, it can
bodyText ||| be seen that the total number of SHO attempts
bodyText ||| (SHO total att) and Ec/N0 difference measurements
bodyText ||| (EcnoDiffNum) is higher in upper part of the SOM. How-
bodyText ||| ever, when the latter is scaled by total number of attempts,
bodyText ||| higher rate of measurements (r EcnoDNum) is in lower part
bodyText ||| of the map. Also, the total number of failuring SHO at-
bodyText ||| tempts (pfail total) is high in upper right corner, but scal-
bodyText ||| ing this by number of attempts tells us that the failure rate
bodyText ||| (r fail) in upper right corner is quite moderate. Instead,
bodyText ||| higher failure rates exists in both lower corners i.e. in clus-
bodyText ||| ters 5 and 8 (see Figure 5).
bodyText ||| Trained SOM codebook vectors are clustered using hier-
bodyText ||| archical Ward algorithm. The clustering result selected by
bodyText ||| Davies-Bouldin index is shown in Figure 5. Four bin Ec/N0
bodyText ||| difference histograms are visualized on top of clustered SOM

figureCaption ||| ables which were not used in SOM training.
bodyText ||| in Figure 6. When component values of SOM (see Figures
bodyText ||| 3, 4 and 6) are compared with clustering result (see Figure
bodyText ||| 5) several types of source target pairs can be found. Most of
bodyText ||| them are behaving as expected, but some of them represent
bodyText ||| handover attempts with certain type of problems.

figureCaption ||| Ward method and Davies-Bouldin validation index.
bodyText ||| To find out the most interesting clusters of the SOM for
bodyText ||| further investigations, distribution of data samples on SOM
bodyText ||| is visualized. In Figure 7a hits of all samples on SOM nodes
bodyText ||| are visualized and in Figure 7b hits of samples with SHO
bodyText ||| failure rate (r fail) larger than 22% are shown. Samples are
bodyText ||| distributed all over the map, only some edge nodes have
bodyText ||| slightly larger hit rate. Lower part of the map has more hits
bodyText ||| when samples with increased failure rate are considered.

figureCaption ||| SOM. In each SOM node a four bin Ec/N0 histogram
figureCaption ||| is shown.
bodyText ||| ent types of SHO failures are shown. Samples are from cell
bodyText ||| pairs in which the rate of selected type of failures is larger
bodyText ||| than 75%. However, handover initialization failures due to
bodyText ||| some other reason than radio channel resources (i.e. pfail ini
bodyText ||| type failures) are obviously more frequent than failures due
bodyText ||| to radio channel initialization problems (pfail ini radio type
bodyText ||| failures). Cell pairs with SHO failures originating mainly
bodyText ||| from these two reasons are mapped on separate clusters.
bodyText ||| All SHO failures due to radio channel initialization are in
bodyText ||| cluster 9 (see Figures 5 and 8b) and most of all other ini-
bodyText ||| tialization failures are in cluster 5 (see Figures 5 and 8a). In
bodyText ||| the following, these two clusters are studied in more detail.
bodyText ||| In Figures 9 and 10 histograms of samples which belong
bodyText ||| to clusters 5 and 9 are shown. These histograms should
bodyText ||| be compared with histograms of whole data set which were
bodyText ||| shown in Figure 2. In histograms of cluster 5 (see Figure
bodyText ||| 9), the average received signal power ratio (av rscp ratio) is
bodyText ||| slightly lower than in general. Distributions of three largest
bodyText ||| Ec/N0 difference measurement bins are completely different
bodyText ||| than corresponding distributions from the whole data set.
bodyText ||| In cluster 5 most of the samples have about 3dB Ec/N0 dif-
bodyText ||| ference (EcnodiffPdf3.0) which means that at least this mea-
bodyText ||| surement makes successful SHOs possible and SHO should
bodyText ||| be performed. Exceptional Ec/N0 difference measurements

figureCaption ||| ples of which more than 75% are failuring due to
figureCaption ||| selected cause are counted.
bodyText ||| of this cluster can also be seen in Figure 6. All the failing
bodyText ||| cell pairs fail in initialization due to other than radio chan-
bodyText ||| nel reasons (pfail ini). Total rate of failures is very high
bodyText ||| (r fail). One reason for high rate of failures can be that all
bodyText ||| the capacity is in use.
bodyText ||| In histograms of cluster 9 (see Figure 10), the average re-
bodyText ||| ceived power ratios are a bit higher than usual, but there are
bodyText ||| no samples with high rate of 3dB Ec/N0 differences (EcnoD-
bodyText ||| iffPdf3.0). However, in such a situation it should be possible
bodyText ||| to perform successful SHOs. The rate of initialization fail-
bodyText ||| ures in radio channels (pfail ini radio) is higher than usually,
bodyText ||| but because only a small part of samples in this cluster have
bodyText ||| above mentioned problems the total SHO failure rate is not
bodyText ||| higher than usually. The total number of samples or cell
bodyText ||| pairs with high rate of initialization failures in SHO is so
bodyText ||| small, that it is impossible to make any further inferences
bodyText ||| from these clusters. It is possible to check histograms of
bodyText ||| only those samples which fulfill the failure rate criteria, but
bodyText ||| the number of samples is anyway quite low.

bodyText ||| uncomplete information on performed tuning operations, it
bodyText ||| is impossible to make any further inferences.

sectionHeader ||| 5. CONCLUSIONS
bodyText ||| In this paper, a data analysis method based on a neu-
bodyText ||| ral network has been presented. The method is utilized in
bodyText ||| data visualization and clustering. The presented method is
bodyText ||| only one possibility for finding data clusters. However, the
bodyText ||| benefits of the proposed method are the decrease in compu-
bodyText ||| tational complexity due to used two-phase clustering algo-
bodyText ||| rithm and the visualization capability of the method. Thus,
bodyText ||| it is well suitable for this kind of explorative data analysis.
bodyText ||| It is desirable to find clusters with characteristics which
bodyText ||| differ from one cluster to another. In the presented method,
bodyText ||| selection of variables and variable weighting factors have
bodyText ||| been used to find interesting clusters. In the preprocess-
bodyText ||| ing phase, also the number of permitted undefined measure-
bodyText ||| ment values in sample vector has an effect on found clusters.
bodyText ||| Sample vectors with high rate of missing values are not so
bodyText ||| usable and describable as samples without them. Vectors
bodyText ||| with missing values can be used in the SOM training but
bodyText ||| the benefit of using them decreases when the rate of unde-
bodyText ||| fined values increases.
bodyText ||| In this study, histograms are used both when preprocess-
bodyText ||| ing methods are decided and when an interpretation for the
bodyText ||| found clusters are looked for. However, clusters can also be
bodyText ||| compared using other visual methods, finding limiting rules
bodyText ||| for variable values in clusters or comparing distributions of
bodyText ||| variable values in clusters using more sophisticated distribu-
bodyText ||| tion comparison measures like Kullback-Leibler divergences
bodyText ||| [6].
bodyText ||| The results which have been obtained using all available
bodyText ||| data sets differ slightly from each other, but due to uncom-
bodyText ||| plete information on network configuration and parameter
bodyText ||| tuning, further inferences cannot be made. However, adding
bodyText ||| this information would offer interesting possibilities to con-
bodyText ||| tinue this study.
