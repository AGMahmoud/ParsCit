sectionHeader ||| ABSTRACT
bodyText ||| Researchers have explored the design of ambient information
bodyText ||| systems across a wide range of physical and screen-based media.
bodyText ||| This work has yielded rich examples of design approaches to the
bodyText ||| problem of presenting information about a user’s world in a way
bodyText ||| that is not distracting, but is aesthetically pleasing, and tangible to
bodyText ||| varying degrees. Despite these successes, accumulating theoretical
bodyText ||| and craft knowledge has been stymied by the lack of a unified
bodyText ||| vocabulary to describe these systems and a consequent lack of a
bodyText ||| framework for understanding their design attributes. We argue that
bodyText ||| this area would significantly benefit from consensus about the
bodyText ||| design space of ambient information systems and the design
bodyText ||| attributes that define and distinguish existing approaches. We
bodyText ||| present a definition of ambient information systems and a
bodyText ||| taxonomy across four design dimensions: Information Capacity,
bodyText ||| Notification Level, Representational Fidelity, and Aesthetic
bodyText ||| Emphasis. Our analysis has uncovered four patterns of system
bodyText ||| design and points to unexplored regions of the design space,
bodyText ||| which may motivate future work in the field.

sectionHeader ||| 1. INTRODUCTION
bodyText ||| From the very first formulation of Ubiquitous Computing, the
bodyText ||| idea of a calmer and more environmentally integrated way of
bodyText ||| displaying information has held intuitive appeal. Weiser called this
bodyText ||| “calm computing” [35] and described the area through an elegant
bodyText ||| example: a small, tangible representation of information in the
bodyText ||| world, a dangling string that would wiggle based on network
bodyText ||| traffic. When information can be conveyed via calm changes in
bodyText ||| the environment, users are more able to focus on their primary
bodyText ||| work tasks while staying aware of non-critical information that

bodyText ||| affects them. Research in this sub-domain goes by various names
bodyText ||| including “ambient displays”, “peripheral displays”, and
bodyText ||| “notification systems”. The breadth of the systems in these broad
bodyText ||| categories is quite large. We seek to disentangle the terminology
bodyText ||| used to describe and categorize the wide array of systems in order
bodyText ||| to provide a common language for discussing research therein.
bodyText ||| An ambient display can represent many types of data, from
bodyText ||| stock prices, to weather forecasts, to the presence or absence of
bodyText ||| colleagues. Maintaining awareness of co-located and distant work
bodyText ||| and social groups has been a long-term research thread in the area
bodyText ||| of Computer Supported Cooperative Work (CSCW) [5, 8]. The
bodyText ||| Tangible Media Group at the MIT Media Lab, directed by Ishii,
bodyText ||| also helped shape the field of ambient computation. They coined
bodyText ||| the term “tangible media,” citing inspiration from Weiser’s vision
bodyText ||| [35] and from Pederson and Sokoler’s AROMA system [29] and
bodyText ||| developed AmbientROOM [17] and Ambient Fixtures [6, 18].
bodyText ||| These systems use ambient displays to make people aware of both
bodyText ||| group activity and other information such as network traffic.
bodyText ||| Recent work in Ambient Intelligence has brought techniques from
bodyText ||| Artificial Intelligence to ambient systems, spearheaded by the
bodyText ||| Disappearing Computer initiative of the European Union [31].
bodyText ||| This research thrust seeks to imbue ambient systems with
bodyText ||| contextual knowledge about the environment. The Roomware
bodyText ||| project has resulted in smart architectural spaces that support
bodyText ||| information conveyance (and group collaboration) [33].
bodyText ||| Researchers have developed systems that use a multitude of
bodyText ||| everyday objects to display information. Examples include lights
bodyText ||| of various sorts [2, 17], sounds [25], shadows [8], artificial flowers
bodyText ||| [18], mobiles [24], and office-décor water fountains [12, 16].
bodyText ||| Further research has sought to use framed photographs [26] and
bodyText ||| larger artistic pictures to represent information from the world in
bodyText ||| an art-like manner [14, 30, 32]. There are also peripheral display
bodyText ||| “modes” of a user’s main desktop, including screensavers like
bodyText ||| What’s Happening [36], information bars and menus such as those
bodyText ||| leveraged in Sideshow and Irwin [6, 22], and alternate panes, like
bodyText ||| Apple’s Dashboard [3]. As one can see, the design space is large.
bodyText ||| All these systems provide a rich history of system design
bodyText ||| principles, approaches, and decisions, but accumulating theoretical
bodyText ||| and craft knowledge has been stymied by the lack of a unified
bodyText ||| vocabulary to define and describe these systems. In this paper we
bodyText ||| propose a set of design choices that developers of ambient
bodyText ||| information systems must confront to build successful and
bodyText ||| compelling systems. First we set out a definition of an ambient
bodyText ||| information system that is a synthesis of the varied definitions
bodyText ||| given in published research. We hone the intuitive set of
page ||| 67
bodyText ||| characteristics that distinguish ambient systems from other
bodyText ||| ubiquitous computing research systems. Next, we propose a set of
bodyText ||| design dimensions for ambient information systems. The four
bodyText ||| dimensions of system design elucidate the main decisions one
bodyText ||| confronts when designing an effective ambient system. Finally, we
bodyText ||| explore the clusters across dimensions to uncover four coherent
bodyText ||| combinations of system designs, which work as design patterns for
bodyText ||| the field. The results also identify new ways of combining the
bodyText ||| design attributes to explore new possibilities for ambient
bodyText ||| information systems.
sectionHeader ||| 2. AMBIENT INFORMATION SYSTEMS
bodyText ||| Many different terms have been used to describe the types of
bodyText ||| systems we discuss in this paper. Three of the most commonly
bodyText ||| used terms are “ambient display,” “peripheral display,” and
bodyText ||| “notification system.” But how does one differentiate these
bodyText ||| terms? Based on general understandings, we claim that:
listItem ||| - all ambient displays are peripheral displays,
listItem ||| - some notification systems are peripheral displays
bodyText ||| (some notification systems are not peripheral but are
bodyText ||| instead the object of focused work and attention)
bodyText ||| The words of researchers themselves likely best explain their
bodyText ||| conceptions of the systems that they have built. Below, we present
bodyText ||| germane definitional quotes.
listItem ||| •	Ishii et al: “[In Ambient Displays] information is moved off
listItem ||| the screen into the physical environment, manifesting itself as
listItem ||| subtle changes in form, movement, sound, color, smell,
listItem ||| temperature, or light. Ambient displays are well suited as a
listItem ||| means to keep users aware of people or general states of large
listItem ||| systems, like network traffic and weather.” [17]
listItem ||| •	Matthews et al: Peripheral displays, then, are displays that
bodyText ||| show information that a person is aware of, but not focused on.
bodyText ||| [24]
listItem ||| •	Matthews et al: “Ambient displays might be defined as those
bodyText ||| that are &quot;minimally attended&quot; (e.g. just salient enough for
bodyText ||| conscious perception) while alerting displays are &quot;maximally
bodyText ||| divided&quot; (e.g. slightly less salient than focal tasks). [24]
listItem ||| •	Stasko et al: Ambient displays typically communicate just one,
bodyText ||| or perhaps a few at the most, pieces of information and the
bodyText ||| aesthetics and visual appeal of the display is often paramount.
bodyText ||| Peripheral displays refer to systems that are out of a person’s
bodyText ||| primary focus of attention and may communicate one or more
bodyText ||| pieces of information.” [32]
listItem ||| •	Mankoff et al: “Ambient displays are abstract and aesthetic
bodyText ||| peripheral displays portraying non-critical information on the
bodyText ||| periphery of a user’s attention... They generally support
bodyText ||| monitoring of non-critical information.” “Ambient displays
bodyText ||| have the ambitious goal of presenting information without
bodyText ||| distracting or burdening the user.” [20]
listItem ||| •	Rounding and Greenberg: “The [notification collage] is
bodyText ||| designed to present info[rmation] as lightweight and peripheral
bodyText ||| objects. It does not demand the full attention of its users: rather
bodyText ||| it can be attended to in passing, where people collaborate should
bodyText ||| the need or desire arise.” [14]
listItem ||| •	McCrickard et al: “Often implemented as ubiquitous systems or
bodyText ||| within a small portion of the traditional desktop, notification
bodyText ||| systems typically deliver information of interest in a parallel,
bodyText ||| multitasking approach, extraneous or supplemental to a user’s
bodyText ||| attention priority.” [21 ]
listItem ||| •	McCrickard et al: Notification systems are defined as
bodyText ||| interfaces that are typically used in a divided-attention,
bodyText ||| multitasking situation, attempting to deliver current, valued
bodyText ||| information through a variety of platforms and modes in an
bodyText ||| efficient and effective manner [21 ].
bodyText ||| The easiest way to explain the differences between systems is
bodyText ||| to look at the design motivations that informed them. Ambient
bodyText ||| displays are those that have pointed aesthetic goals and present a
bodyText ||| very small number of information elements. These systems are a
bodyText ||| proper subset of peripheral displays, which can appear either in the
bodyText ||| environment or on secondary or even primary computer displays.
bodyText ||| Notification systems’ design motivation results from divided
bodyText ||| attention situations. As such, they can be equal to a primary work
bodyText ||| task in their attentional needs or be secondary. When notification
bodyText ||| systems are designed to be secondary to a primary task, the
bodyText ||| systems are appropriately defined as peripheral.
bodyText ||| In this paper, we propose the term ambient information system
bodyText ||| as the unit of study and define the behavioral characteristics of
bodyText ||| such as systems as follows:
listItem ||| •	Display information that is important but not critical.
listItem ||| •	Can move from the periphery to the focus of attention and
listItem ||| back again.
listItem ||| •	Focus on the tangible; representations in the environment.
listItem ||| •	Provide subtle changes to reflect updates in information
listItem ||| (should not be distracting).
listItem ||| •	Are aesthetically pleasing and environmentally appropriate.
listItem ||| 3. PREVIOUS TAXONOMIES
bodyText ||| A small number of research papers that describe ambient
bodyText ||| information systems also include extended discussions of the
bodyText ||| design dimensions that motivate and contextualize their work. The
bodyText ||| authors provide dimensions to compare and contrast their systems
bodyText ||| to others in order to explain their design rationales.
bodyText ||| Matthews et al use the dimensions notification level,
bodyText ||| transition, and abstraction to characterize systems in this space
bodyText ||| [24]. They developed the Peripheral Display Toolkit [23] that
bodyText ||| helps people to develop ambient information displays more easily.
bodyText ||| Their concept of notification level means the relative importance
bodyText ||| of a particular data stream. Transitions are the programmatic
bodyText ||| changes to the display, based on the data. Transitions include
bodyText ||| fading, scrolling, or animation effects. They define abstraction as
bodyText ||| the mapping that takes a piece of numerical or ordinal data and
bodyText ||| turns it into something that the ambient display can use, something
bodyText ||| “more easily interpreted with less [user] attention.”
bodyText ||| Matthews et al segregate notification level into five levels:
bodyText ||| Ignore, Change Blind, Make Aware, Interrupt, and Demand
bodyText ||| Attention. The gradations run from low, a system ignoring the
bodyText ||| change in the data, to high, a system demanding attention in a way
bodyText ||| that must also be explicitly dismissed. They propose categories of
bodyText ||| transition: interrupt, make aware, and change blind. Finally, they
bodyText ||| bifurcate abstraction into feature abstraction or degradation.
bodyText ||| McCrickard et al introduce a different set of three dimensions
bodyText ||| to classify notification systems: interruption, reaction, and
bodyText ||| comprehension [21]. Interruption is defined psychologically,
bodyText ||| similar to Matthews’ notion, “as an event prompting transition and
bodyText ||| reallocation of attention focus from a [primary] task to the
bodyText ||| notification.” Reaction is defined as the rapid response to a given
bodyText ||| stimulus, while comprehension is the long-term notion of
bodyText ||| remembering and sense-making.
page ||| 68
bodyText ||| McCrickard et al then plot the design space as a 3-tuple of
bodyText ||| interaction, reaction, and comprehension (IRC). Each dimension is
bodyText ||| assigned a rating of high (1) or low (0), creating models like 0-1-0.
bodyText ||| They label these models with meaningful names like “Ambient
bodyText ||| Media, 0-0-1” “Indicator, 0-1-0” and “Critical Activity Monitor,
bodyText ||| 1-1-1.” Eight models serve as the corners of a design space. The
bodyText ||| resulting space, it should be noted, is larger than the design space
bodyText ||| of ambient information systems as we discuss in this paper
bodyText ||| because it contains games, secondary displays, and critical activity
bodyText ||| monitors (which by our definition, are notification systems that are
bodyText ||| not also peripheral systems). McCrickard also classifies a set of 14
bodyText ||| extant systems in the design space on the three dimensions.
bodyText ||| Both of these taxonomies deal thoroughly with interruption
bodyText ||| and detail some of the criteria for categorizing systems along this
bodyText ||| design dimension. We extend this analysis to other dimensions of
bodyText ||| data representation, flexibility, and aesthetics. This more holistic
bodyText ||| view points out design trade-offs between aesthetic emphasis and
bodyText ||| and flexibility, and between a system’s information display style
bodyText ||| and display capacity.
bodyText ||| Mankoff et al proposed a set of heuristics for evaluating
bodyText ||| ambient systems [20], which may also assist system builders. The
bodyText ||| heuristics attempt to give guidance for the formative evaluation of
bodyText ||| ambient systems, but they also can be viewed as high-level design
bodyText ||| guidelines, such as “The display should be designed to give ‘just
bodyText ||| enough’ information. Too much information cramps the display,
bodyText ||| and too little makes the display less useful.”
sectionHeader ||| 4. DESIGN DIMENSIONS OF AMBIENT
sectionHeader ||| SYSTEMS
bodyText ||| Designers of ambient information systems make decisions
bodyText ||| about how much information to display, what specific aspects to
bodyText ||| depict, and how exactly to display it, transparently or abstractly,
bodyText ||| on a monitor or via a decorative sculpture. We present four design
bodyText ||| dimensions that capture the space of ambient information systems.
bodyText ||| The dimensions can be thought of as design choices or design
bodyText ||| questions that system builders must answer. The dimensions are:
listItem ||| •	information capacity
listItem ||| •	notification level
listItem ||| •	representational fidelity
listItem ||| •	aesthetic emphasis
bodyText ||| We rank 19 research systems and three consumer ambient
bodyText ||| information systems on each of the four axes. Each axis is divided
bodyText ||| into 5 bands, from low to high. We place systems into groups
bodyText ||| based on information from published conference and journal
bodyText ||| proceedings, including images and videos of systems in use if
bodyText ||| available. The 19 systems we chose are not intended to be an
bodyText ||| exhaustive list of all ambient information systems in the research
bodyText ||| literature. The 19 systems are representative of the breadth of the
bodyText ||| field and we feel that attempting an exhaustive list, while
bodyText ||| amplifying completeness, would not significantly alter the design
bodyText ||| dimensions.
bodyText ||| Research systems that we analyzed include: Bus Mobile [24],
bodyText ||| Dangling String [35], Digital Family Portrait [26], InfoCanvas
bodyText ||| [33], Informative Art [30], Information Percolator [16], Irwin [22],
bodyText ||| Kandinsky [11], Kiumra [19], Lumitouch [5], Notification Collage
bodyText ||| [14], Scope [34], Sideshow [7], Table Fountain [12], Water Lamp
bodyText ||| [8], and What’s Happening [36]. We include three consumer
bodyText ||| systems that fit our definition of ambient information systems,
bodyText ||| Ambient Devices Ambient Orb [2], the My Yahoo! web portal
bodyText ||| [27] and Apple’s Dashboard [3].
bodyText ||| Figure 1 shows the four dimensions for our analysis, and
bodyText ||| each of the 19 systems placed into a group along each. Thin
bodyText ||| colored lines trace the rankings of systems on each axis, similar to
bodyText ||| a parallel coordinates plot. Each axis has values that range from
bodyText ||| low to high through five grades. The dimensions of notification
bodyText ||| level and representational fidelity have more descriptive axis
bodyText ||| labels that will be explained in detail below.
subsectionHeader ||| 4.1 Information Capacity
bodyText ||| Ambient information systems are created to convey
bodyText ||| information to users—information that typically is important to a
bodyText ||| user’s sense of wellbeing and general awareness, but not critical to
bodyText ||| their work or personal life. Information capacity represents the
bodyText ||| number of discrete information sources that a system can
bodyText ||| represent. Some systems are capable of displaying a single piece
bodyText ||| of data such as the current price of a stock index. Others can
bodyText ||| display the value of 20 (or more) different information elements
bodyText ||| on one screen. We rank systems from “Low” to “High” on this
bodyText ||| design dimension.
bodyText ||| Information elements are discrete information “nuggets”. For
bodyText ||| example, if a system monitors campus shuttle buses, each bus is a
bodyText ||| single nugget. If the system can represent both the time to a
bodyText ||| location and a direction of travel, then there are two nuggets of
bodyText ||| information for each bus that is monitored.
bodyText ||| Information capacity makes visible the design trade-off
bodyText ||| between space and time. A designer can increase the information
bodyText ||| capacity of a display by increasing the space for information to be
bodyText ||| presented or by creating a display that transitions through a set of
bodyText ||| views over time. If a system is designed with multiple views or
bodyText ||| uses scrolling, we rank it in the top tier, since the number of pieces
bodyText ||| of information that it could display is arbitrarily large.
bodyText ||| A further caveat about information capacity is necessary.
bodyText ||| Some of the analyzed systems such as InfoCanvas, Sideshow, and
bodyText ||| Dashboard are user-configured and user-customizable. This means
bodyText ||| that these and other systems could potentially be made to display
bodyText ||| hundreds of elements. Instead of attempting to calculate a
bodyText ||| theoretical maximum throughput for the display in these cases, we
bodyText ||| use the system designer’s naturalistic portrayal in their published
bodyText ||| work to determine the “everyday maximum.” Each of these
bodyText ||| systems is also in the top tier of information capacity.
bodyText ||| The design dimension of information capacity has a barbell
bodyText ||| distribution. Five of the 19 systems display a single information
bodyText ||| element and are ranked “Low”. Conversely, there are eight
bodyText ||| systems that display from ten to 20 information elements, with
bodyText ||| some systems having the potential to display more and these are
bodyText ||| ranked “High.” Only a few systems take a middle-ground
bodyText ||| approach, attempting to display a small number (from two to ten)
bodyText ||| of information elements.
bodyText ||| The systems with low ratings on the attribute of information
bodyText ||| conveyance are those that are physical displays. Fountains,
bodyText ||| glowing lights, and office-decoration sculptures afford designers
bodyText ||| only so much flexibility for changes.
page ||| 69
figureCaption ||| Figure 1: Parallel Coordinate plot of 19 existing ambient information systems across four design dimensions. Colored lines trace
figureCaption ||| each system’s ranking along the design dimensions. Different colors are used to denote groups of systems which are similar as
figureCaption ||| explained more fully in Section 5.
figureCaption ||| Since the number of changes possible is small, the total number
figureCaption ||| of information nuggets that can be represented is
figureCaption ||| correspondingly small. The systems with high information
figureCaption ||| conveyance are those that are presented on LCD screens. The
figureCaption ||| systems that run at full screen (instead of as a small section of a
figureCaption ||| focused main monitor) are ranked the highest.
subsectionHeader ||| 4.2 Notification Level
bodyText ||| Notification level is the degree to which system alerts are
bodyText ||| meant to interrupt a user. Notification level is a design attribute
bodyText ||| that is present in the two taxonomies of ambient and peripheral
bodyText ||| information systems we reviewed earlier. Matthews et al
bodyText ||| subdivides notification level into five categories: ignore, change
bodyText ||| blind, make aware, interrupt, and demand attention. For our
bodyText ||| analysis we adopt those categories but replace the lowest level
bodyText ||| of system alert function, ignore (a degenerate case) with user
bodyText ||| poll. Systems such as Apple Dashboard and My Yahoo! do not
bodyText ||| always appear in a user’s environment and must be explicitly
bodyText ||| called to the fore.
bodyText ||| Notification level can be thought of as the “ambience” of
bodyText ||| the systems in question. Some systems in the ambient space are
bodyText ||| quiet, and afford opportunistic glances to the information, while
bodyText ||| others provide more strident alerts by blinking, flashing,
bodyText ||| beeping, or even opening dialog windows. Systems that provide
bodyText ||| unobtrusive change blind or make aware notifications to the user
bodyText ||| are at the core of the ambient information system design space.
bodyText ||| Systems that interrupt users with alarms or that demand
bodyText ||| attention (by launching system dialog windows) are not subtle,
bodyText ||| so are further from the core concept of ambient information
bodyText ||| systems, though, as Matthews et al argues, the smooth transition
bodyText ||| from more subtle to more jarring is an interesting design
bodyText ||| direction for ambient system designers.
bodyText ||| Notification level is the designer-intended level of alert.
bodyText ||| We do not take pains to distinguish between systems that are
bodyText ||| proven to be “change blind” through user experimentation
bodyText ||| versus those that merely claim change blindness. We remain
bodyText ||| agnostic here about the techniques used for ensuring subtlety
bodyText ||| including slow animation, scrolling, and fading (these
bodyText ||| implementation details are at a lower level of design rationale).
bodyText ||| Once the decision has been made to produce a system with
bodyText ||| change blind transitions, the designer must then produce system
bodyText ||| transitions that meet the goal in the specifics of the system. Our
bodyText ||| analysis focuses on the high level decision on the part of the
bodyText ||| designer or design team.
bodyText ||| The distribution of systems here shows a good fit to our
bodyText ||| definition of ambient information systems. It is apparent that
bodyText ||| most ambient information systems adhere to the central notion
bodyText ||| of subtle visual or representational changes. The vast majority of
bodyText ||| ambient information systems fall into the change blind and make
bodyText ||| aware transition categories (somewhat low and medium). Few
bodyText ||| systems are designed to interrupt users or demand attention.
page ||| 70
bodyText ||| Two that do however are Scope and Sideshow. Note that most
bodyText ||| systems that are physical displays do not have make-aware or
bodyText ||| interruption-level alerts, much less demand attention alerts. The
bodyText ||| Bus Mobile does enable make-aware transitions, when, for
bodyText ||| example, the last bus of the day approaches.
subsectionHeader ||| 4.3 Representational Fidelity
bodyText ||| Representational fidelity describes a system’s display
bodyText ||| components and how the data from the world is encoded into
bodyText ||| patterns, pictures, words, or sounds. Some systems reproduce
bodyText ||| the information being monitored in a very direct way, while
bodyText ||| others are much more abstract in their representation. Matthews
bodyText ||| et al’s taxonomy characterizes this design choice as abstraction,
bodyText ||| but only distinguishes two sub-types, feature degradation and
bodyText ||| feature abstraction. We consider this design dimension to be rich
bodyText ||| and complex, so we will try to tease apart the many different
bodyText ||| types of abstraction that appear in ambient information systems.
bodyText ||| Representational fidelity can be described in the language
bodyText ||| of Semiotics, the branch of Philosophy that deals with signs, sign
bodyText ||| systems (such as natural languages) and their meanings. As such
bodyText ||| it has an accepted vocabulary for the elements of a symbolic
bodyText ||| representation. Semiotics can help analyze the way that
bodyText ||| particular signifiers—words, pictures, sounds, and other
bodyText ||| things—stand for the things they represent.
bodyText ||| A semiotic sign is made up of three parts [28]. The object
bodyText ||| is called the signified; it is the physical thing or idea that the
bodyText ||| sign stands for. The signifier is the representation of the object,
bodyText ||| which could be a word, a picture, or a a sound. The sense is the
bodyText ||| understanding that an observer gets from seeing or experiencing
bodyText ||| either the signified or its signifier. The signifier and the signified
bodyText ||| need not have any direct relationship. However, both the
bodyText ||| signified and the signifier create the same sense in the head of an
bodyText ||| observer; seeing a log aflame and seeing the word “fire” create
bodyText ||| the same meaning for a person.
bodyText ||| Ambient information systems, in the vocabulary of
bodyText ||| semiotics, contain one or more signs. Each sign has its object,
bodyText ||| information in the world, and its representation, the lights,
bodyText ||| pictures, or sounds used to signify that information. Many
bodyText ||| ambient information systems contain multiple signs—each
bodyText ||| picture element standing for a different piece of information.
bodyText ||| The theory of Semiotics also helps to explain the notion
bodyText ||| that some signs are transparent, easily understood, while others
bodyText ||| are metaphorical and still others are abstract. Signs can be
bodyText ||| symbolic, iconic, or indexical. Symbolic signs are those that are
bodyText ||| completely arbitrary. For example languages are arbitrary, for
bodyText ||| the word “bachelor” has no more natural relation to an
bodyText ||| unmarried man than does the word “foobar. ” Symbolic signs
bodyText ||| are those signs for which a code, or rule-following convention,
bodyText ||| is required to understand. Language characters and numbers are
bodyText ||| all symbolic, as are abstract visual representations (the color red
bodyText ||| standing for “danger”). Iconic signs are those signs that have an
bodyText ||| intermediate degree of transparency to the signified object.
bodyText ||| Iconic signs include metaphors as well as doodles, drawings,
bodyText ||| and caricatures. Icons represent their objects by having some
bodyText ||| similarity or resemblance to the object or to an essential aspects
bodyText ||| of the object. Indexical signs are those that are directly
bodyText ||| connected to the signified. Examples include measuring
bodyText ||| instruments, maps, and photographs.
bodyText ||| We have subdivided the three main categories of
bodyText ||| representational fidelity to distinguish between ambient
bodyText ||| information systems. We propose five groups, ranked from
bodyText ||| indexical (high) to symbolic (low):
listItem ||| •	INDEXICAL: measuring instruments, maps,
listItem ||| photographs
listItem ||| •	ICONIC: drawings, doodles, caricatures
listItem ||| •	ICONIC: Metaphors
listItem ||| ■ SYMBOLIC: language symbols (letters and numbers)
listItem ||| ■ SYMBOLIC: abstract symbols
bodyText ||| Some ambient information systems have displays that do
bodyText ||| not afford representational flexibility, because of the constraints
bodyText ||| of the display. For example, the LiveWire system and the
bodyText ||| Ambient Orb cannot represent language symbols, nor can they
bodyText ||| convey indexical forms like photographs. However, some
bodyText ||| flexibility is present. The systems might map information in an
bodyText ||| arbitrary way, remaining fully abstract (representing stock
bodyText ||| increases with the color green and losses with the color red), or
bodyText ||| it could map information more metaphorically, as would be the
bodyText ||| case if LiveWire were connected to information from a
bodyText ||| seismograph or ocean tides. As one can see, the question
bodyText ||| concerning representational flexibility requires one to consider
bodyText ||| both the display and the information that is displayed.
bodyText ||| The InfoCanvas is a very flexible system when considering
bodyText ||| representational fidelity. The InfoCanvas uses all five types of
bodyText ||| representational fidelity. It uses abstract symbols, such as the
bodyText ||| color red standing for traffic being stopped, metaphors, like a
bodyText ||| cartoon drawing of a cloud representing cloudy conditions, and
bodyText ||| also photographs and words of news stories, which are fully
bodyText ||| indexical. We show this ability for a system to straddle multiple
bodyText ||| representational forms by duplicating the system in each
bodyText ||| category and noting them with an asterisk (see Figure 1).
bodyText ||| Systems which are designed to represent information at multiple
bodyText ||| levels of fidelity are: Apple’s Dashboard, InfoCanvas,
bodyText ||| Informative Art, Notification Collage, Sideshow, and What’s
bodyText ||| Happening. In these cases, we draw the parallel coordinate plot
bodyText ||| to the top-most tier of representational fidelity for each system.
bodyText ||| The majority of systems however, only afford a single level
bodyText ||| of representational fidelity. Many of the sculptural displays only
bodyText ||| afford symbolic, that is abstract, representations, while a smaller
bodyText ||| number afford text and photographic representations.
subsectionHeader ||| 4.4 Aesthetic Emphasis
bodyText ||| The final dimension concerns the relative importance of the
bodyText ||| aesthetics of the display. Some system designers seek to build
bodyText ||| displays and artifacts with sculptural or artistic conventions. For
bodyText ||| these systems, being visually pleasing is a primary objective.
bodyText ||| Others however place relatively little focus on aesthetics and
bodyText ||| typically focus more on information communication ability.
bodyText ||| Since aesthetic judgment is at its core a subjective phenomenon,
bodyText ||| we do not judge systems on their relative artistic merits. Instead
bodyText ||| we attempt to rank ambient information systems by our
bodyText ||| perception of the importance given to aesthetics. There is often a
bodyText ||| tradeoff made between communication capacity,
bodyText ||| representational fidelity, and aesthetics, a relationship that we
bodyText ||| explore in this section.
bodyText ||| Ambient information systems are intended to be visible;
bodyText ||| positioned on a shelf, hung on the wall, or placed as a small
bodyText ||| sculpture on a desk, the systems are seen not just by a user, but
bodyText ||| also by co-workers, colleagues, or family members. There are a
page ||| 71
bodyText ||| multitude of approaches when it comes to building aesthetically
bodyText ||| pleasing devices. One approach is to build systems that mirror
bodyText ||| existing artworks by a particular artist, as is the case in
bodyText ||| Kandinsky and Informative Art. A second approach is to design
bodyText ||| a display that is representative of a particular style or art
bodyText ||| movement. InfoCanvas, through its use of themes, allows the
bodyText ||| display to take on characteristics of Asian water-color paintings,
bodyText ||| for example.
bodyText ||| We rank systems on the design dimension of aesthetic
bodyText ||| emphasis as low, somewhat low, medium, somewhat high and
bodyText ||| high. Note again that we are not assessing the degree to which
bodyText ||| the systems are successful as art. We are providing a subjective
bodyText ||| measure of how much the system designers focused on
bodyText ||| aesthetics and how much they emphasized aesthetic
bodyText ||| considerations in their research and design decisions.
bodyText ||| Most systems that we analyzed had medium or somewhat
bodyText ||| high degrees of aesthetic emphasis (12 of 19). The decisions of
bodyText ||| designers to strive for visually pleasing displays is most clear in
bodyText ||| the cases where the display is intended to leverage the work of
bodyText ||| existing artists. The physical ambient information displays are
bodyText ||| often sculptural in their design decisions. They attempt to set
bodyText ||| themselves off from the rest of the environment, often on
bodyText ||| pedestals or stands. Their capability to display much information
bodyText ||| (information capacity) is often limited by their design clarity and
bodyText ||| austerity. We consider this design trade-off in the next section.
bodyText ||| Systems that we ranked at the middle of the spectrum of
bodyText ||| aesthetic emphasis are those which are not intended by their
bodyText ||| designers to be art worthy of contemplation as art objects. But
bodyText ||| they are explicitly intended to be viewed as calm pleasing
bodyText ||| objects and displays. Apple’s Dashboard widgets have a clean
bodyText ||| design sense about them, as does Kimura, What’s Happening
bodyText ||| and the Information Percolator. The systems that are ranked low
bodyText ||| on aesthetic emphasis are Scope, Sideshow, Bus Mobile, Elvin,
bodyText ||| and My Yahoo!. These systems put information conveyance at a
bodyText ||| higher priority than being aesthetically pleasing. They are still
bodyText ||| calm and environmentally appropriate, but their designers did
bodyText ||| not emphasize their aesthetic qualities. Cleary, some systems
bodyText ||| that are early-stage prototypes like Bus Mobile, may not have
bodyText ||| the aesthetic polish of more finished systems.
sectionHeader ||| 5. FOUR DESIGN PATTERNS
bodyText ||| In this section, we introduce four design patterns for
bodyText ||| ambient information systems, after Alexander’s pattern language
bodyText ||| for architectural studies [1]. The design patterns illustrate four
bodyText ||| coherent combinations of the four design dimensions previously
bodyText ||| presented. We have already pointed out trends and clusters that
bodyText ||| are present in each particular design dimension. However, there
bodyText ||| are fruitful conclusions for system designers as we consider the
bodyText ||| interaction between the design dimensions to form design
bodyText ||| patterns.
bodyText ||| Considering the clusters of systems in each dimension and
bodyText ||| the correspondences that are visible in the parallel coordinate
bodyText ||| plot, we find four main archetypes in existing ambient
bodyText ||| information system design: Symbolic Sculptural Display,
bodyText ||| Multiple-Information Consolidators, Information Monitor
bodyText ||| Display, and High Throughput Textual Display. Figure 2
bodyText ||| shows the pattern of each archetype across the dimensions.
figureCaption ||| Figure 2: a-d System design archetypes shown in the context
bodyText ||| of the design space. Heavy boxes indicate core design
bodyText ||| decisions, while light boxes show alternate choices.
bodyText ||| Symbolic Sculptural Displays are ambient information systems
bodyText ||| that display very few pieces of information, usually a single
bodyText ||| element. They represent information in an abstract sculptural
bodyText ||| way with light, water, or moving objects. They are intended to
bodyText ||| be decorative objects for a home or office setting and as such are
bodyText ||| highly aesthetic in their design (see Figure 2a). This design
bodyText ||| pattern is a core of ambient system design, and accounts for six
bodyText ||| of our analyzed systems: Ambient Orb, Dangling String, Digital
bodyText ||| Family Portrait, Information Percolator, Lumitouch, Table
bodyText ||| Fountain, and Water Lamp. The Digital Family Portrait
bodyText ||| combines multiple information sources and so truly represents
bodyText ||| more information than the other members of this type.
page ||| 72
bodyText ||| Multiple Information Consolidators are ambient systems that
bodyText ||| display many individual pieces of information in a consolidated
bodyText ||| manner. They are typically screen-based in order to convey
bodyText ||| much information and make users aware of changes to that
bodyText ||| information (usually by blinking the visual representation of a
bodyText ||| certain element). They are reasonably aesthetically motivated,
bodyText ||| but all clearly demonstrate the trade-off between aesthetics and
bodyText ||| customization and information capacity (see Figure 2b). Systems
bodyText ||| which illustrate this design pattern are: Kandinsky, Kimura,
bodyText ||| InfoCanvas, Notification Collage, and What’s Happening.
bodyText ||| Kandinsky departs from the other systems in that it is explicitly
bodyText ||| modeled on the fine art of Kandinsky, and as such is highly
bodyText ||| stylized and design-focused. It does so at the expense of
bodyText ||| flexibility, since it can only display photographs in its slots.
bodyText ||| Information Monitor Displays are displays that are a
bodyText ||| peripheral part of a user’s computer desktop. As such, they
bodyText ||| afford different interactions and design choices. They display
bodyText ||| multiple sources of information, and do so usually by visual
bodyText ||| metaphors. They are capable of notifying users in multiple ways
bodyText ||| about changes in the source data, including subtle awareness,
bodyText ||| interrupting, and even demanding user attention when necessary
bodyText ||| (i.e., requiring the user to switch focus to dismiss a notification).
bodyText ||| The systems achieve aesthetics, but their primary purpose is not
bodyText ||| good looks (see Figure 2c). Examples of this design archetype
bodyText ||| include: Scope, and Sideshow.
bodyText ||| High Throughput Textual Display systems are those that use
bodyText ||| text and very simple graphics (icons) to denote information.
bodyText ||| They are capable of representing voluminous information, but
bodyText ||| do not draw attention with interruption-level notifications. These
bodyText ||| systems are not primarily as concerned with aesthetics as they
bodyText ||| are with information conveyance (see Figure 2d). These systems
bodyText ||| are simple but efficient for certain types of tasks. Examples of
bodyText ||| this design archetype are: Elvin, and My Yahoo!.
bodyText ||| The four design archetypes cover nearly all of the analyzed
bodyText ||| systems, but do not cleanly categorize three systems. Apple’s
bodyText ||| Dashboard system is most similar to a Multiple Information
bodyText ||| Consolidator. It fails being a pure example of this archetype
bodyText ||| because of its inability to alert users to changes in information –
bodyText ||| it requires users poll the system by calling up the transparent
bodyText ||| pane via a hot key. The Bus Mobile is an early stage prototype,
bodyText ||| and as such is not concerned with aesthetics to a large degree.
bodyText ||| With a higher degree of aesthetic emphasis, it might be closer to
bodyText ||| a Information Monitor Display (albeit a physical instead of
bodyText ||| screen-based system). Informative Art is quite unlike the four
bodyText ||| design archetypes. Informative Art has high aesthetic emphasis,
bodyText ||| but low information capacity (e.g. 5 or 6 city’s weather forecast
bodyText ||| information). It is metaphorical and abstract in its information
bodyText ||| mapping fidelity.
sectionHeader ||| 6. EXTENDING THE PATTERNS
bodyText ||| The four patterns for system design can help designers to
bodyText ||| make appropriate choices as they develop new ambient
bodyText ||| information systems. The design patterns can be used as models
bodyText ||| so a designer can decide to build “an information monitor
bodyText ||| display for a home health awareness application”, or “a set of
bodyText ||| symbolic sculptural displays for work-group collaboration”.
bodyText ||| Further, the designer may be depart from the pattern, by building
bodyText ||| up a system’s range of possible notification levels, or by
bodyText ||| choosing to trade aesthetics for increased information capacity.
bodyText ||| However, our analysis also points at what has not yet been
bodyText ||| explored. The four design patterns show four coherent
bodyText ||| combinations, but they are not the only possibilities for building
bodyText ||| useful ambient systems. Combined with longer-term trends in
bodyText ||| the fields of Ambient Intelligence and Ubiquitous Computing,
bodyText ||| new archetypes for system design are emerging. We note
bodyText ||| possibilities here, which change both the dimensions and the
bodyText ||| four design patterns.
bodyText ||| We do not expect the information capacity for ambient
bodyText ||| systems to increase by dramatically. Though scrolling or time-
bodyText ||| divided ambient systems (What’s Happening, Elvin) can already
bodyText ||| display data elements numbering in the hundreds, simultaneous
bodyText ||| visual displays are usually limited to 25 or 30 elements by
bodyText ||| readability and user learnability. Ambient information systems
bodyText ||| will not turn into information visualization systems showing
bodyText ||| thousands of data points. However, contextual sets of
bodyText ||| information may be useful for ambient systems in specialized
bodyText ||| environments. Systems which display contextual sets of
bodyText ||| information like that of the Bus Mobile (all of the buses on a
bodyText ||| college campus) or Scope (email and calendar data) would
bodyText ||| increase the number of systems in the middle portion of this
bodyText ||| design dimension.
bodyText ||| We also expect to see changes to the design dimension of
bodyText ||| representational flexibility. Designers have begun to explore the
bodyText ||| affordances of abstract and symbolic mappings between
bodyText ||| information sources and their representations. We see this
bodyText ||| continuing, with new systems focusing on personally relevant
bodyText ||| symbolic representations, and utilizing metaphors from the
bodyText ||| natural and built worlds. Another shift that we foresee is the
bodyText ||| designers creating systems where multiple information sources
bodyText ||| and aspects interact to affect a single part of the representation.
bodyText ||| This is apparent already in Digital Family Portrait where the size
bodyText ||| of the butterflies represents “activity,” even though activity is
bodyText ||| not the reading from a single sensor, but it instead a reading
bodyText ||| from multiple sensors in a home. Informative Art also has
bodyText ||| aspects of this approach, changing both the color and
bodyText ||| dimensions of squares based on two different aspects of weather.
bodyText ||| As regards aesthetic emphasis, we foresee a more radical
bodyText ||| change. We predict further exploration of the space of truly
bodyText ||| artistically motivated ambient information systems. These
bodyText ||| generative artworks use information from the world to drive
bodyText ||| their behavior and ask (and answer) art questions as well as
bodyText ||| technology questions. Though most of these works are outside
bodyText ||| the academy (they are shown in galleries instead of computer
bodyText ||| science conferences), Bolen and Mateas’ Office Plant #1 [4] is a
bodyText ||| sculpture that characterizes the mood of a user’s email stream
bodyText ||| and conveys it via transformations of a robotic plant. These
bodyText ||| systems are going to create a new design space above the top tier
bodyText ||| that we depict in this work.
sectionHeader ||| 7. CONCLUSIONS
bodyText ||| In this work we synthesize a definition that distinguishes
bodyText ||| research in ambient information systems from that of
bodyText ||| notification systems and peripheral displays. We propose four
bodyText ||| design dimensions, rank systems to show clusters, and uncover
bodyText ||| four design patterns on which system developers may model
bodyText ||| their system designs. Future work will expand the four
bodyText ||| dimensions to include aspects of the social interaction and
bodyText ||| impact that system have on the behavior of individuals and
bodyText ||| groups.
bodyText ||| In this work we point toward open areas in the design
bodyText ||| space, and we point to new design directions that may fill these
bodyText ||| gaps. Future work may also turn this taxonomy into an
bodyText ||| evaluation framework for ambient information systems.
