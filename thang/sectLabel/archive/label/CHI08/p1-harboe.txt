sectionHeader ||| ABSTRACT
bodyText ||| We examine how ambient displays can augment social
bodyText ||| television. Social TV 2 is an interactive television solution
bodyText ||| that incorporates two ambient displays to convey to
bodyText ||| participants an aggregate view of their friendsâ current TV-
bodyText ||| watching status. Social TV 2 also allows users to see which
bodyText ||| television shows friends and family are watching and send
bodyText ||| lightweight messages from within the TV-viewing
bodyText ||| experience. Through a two-week field study we found the
bodyText ||| ambient displays to be an integral part of the experience.
bodyText ||| We present the results of our field study with a discussion
bodyText ||| of the implications for future social systems in the home.

sectionHeader ||| INTRODUCTION
bodyText ||| Although Internet use is gaining importance, TV watching
bodyText ||| is still the primary recreational activity of American adults,
bodyText ||| accounting for half of all leisure time [7]. Although there is
bodyText ||| great social potential in TV watching as a shared activity
bodyText ||| and a topic for conversation [20], at least half of all people
bodyText ||| usually watch alone [10].
bodyText ||| Many technologies coming out of the interactive television
bodyText ||| (iTV) field, such as Video-On-Demand and Personal Video
bodyText ||| Recorders (PVRs), focus on providing personalization and
bodyText ||| greater individual control. They cater to viewers as isolated
bodyText ||| individuals, and fragment audiences further [16].
bodyText ||| However, in recent years âsocial television,â the idea of
bodyText ||| using communication technology to connect TV viewers, in
bodyText ||| order to create remotely shared experiences around TV

bodyText ||| content, has received much attention. Proponents of this
bodyText ||| idea see television as a social experience capable of
bodyText ||| reinforcing bonds in strong-tie relationships. TV
bodyText ||| programming can provide the common, shared experience
bodyText ||| that serves as a basis for socialization, even for groups who
bodyText ||| are already fairly close [29]. Social television systems
bodyText ||| typically integrate some combination of text chat, voice
bodyText ||| chat or video chat with TV programming, and use presence
bodyText ||| to provide awareness of the status and context of other users
bodyText ||| of the system [5, 9, 15, 23]. These efforts tie into earlier
bodyText ||| CMC work on telepresence and co-viewing, but come at the
bodyText ||| design and research questions from a different angle.
bodyText ||| In previous work we noted that users of social television
bodyText ||| systems would benefit from features that indicate favorable
bodyText ||| times for shared viewing [15]. One solution is to use
bodyText ||| always-on ambient displays to let users be aware of when
bodyText ||| others are watching TV. From a research standpoint, we can
bodyText ||| then examine how this kind of awareness helps or
bodyText ||| encourages people to get in touch through their social
bodyText ||| televisions, and in particular, how it is used to initiate and
bodyText ||| escalate communication sessions. As no extended field
bodyText ||| trials of social television systems have been reported to
bodyText ||| date, these important issues remain largely unexplored.
bodyText ||| In this paper, we present results from a two-week field
bodyText ||| study of Social TV 2, an experimental social television
bodyText ||| system that incorporates an ambient display component to
bodyText ||| provide awareness of remote viewers. Two groups of five
bodyText ||| households participated, with the members of each group
bodyText ||| comprising an existing social circle. In addition to standard
bodyText ||| social television functionality, Social TV 2 incorporates
bodyText ||| ambient displays in order to keep users aware of the
bodyText ||| participation of their friends and family. We found that the
bodyText ||| ambient displays proved to be a defining component of the
bodyText ||| system. The displays were effective indicators of good
bodyText ||| times to use Social TV 2, increased participantsâ awareness
bodyText ||| of othersâ TV-viewing schedules, and encouraged
bodyText ||| participation in the system. This participation often began
bodyText ||| as a glance at the ambient display â a quick check on the
bodyText ||| status of a participantâs social network, but would
bodyText ||| frequently escalate to deeper or more extended
bodyText ||| communication. In this way, participants began treating TV
bodyText ||| watching as a fundamentally social activity. Thus, the

figureCaption ||| orb is visible in the upper left, above the television.
figureCaption ||| addition of ambient displays helped to fulfill the design
figureCaption ||| objectives of the system.
bodyText ||| In the following sections, we describe the design of our
bodyText ||| Social TV 2 prototype, which we then put in the context of
bodyText ||| existing work in both the social television and ambient
bodyText ||| display literature. We outline unanswered questions that led
bodyText ||| us to initiate this work and describe the mixed-method
bodyText ||| approach to our field study. We then present our results,
bodyText ||| describing how the ambient devices functioned as
bodyText ||| traditional presence displays and as components of a more
bodyText ||| complex communication system. Lastly, we show how
bodyText ||| these findings bear on other social applications in the home,
bodyText ||| and outline our future goals for social television research
bodyText ||| and design.
sectionHeader ||| SOCIAL TV 2
bodyText ||| Social TV 2 follows Social TV, the system previously
bodyText ||| described in Harboe et al. [15]. It is a prototype system that
bodyText ||| allows remotely located friends and family to experience
bodyText ||| some of the benefits of sitting next to one another on the
bodyText ||| couch and watching a TV program together (Figure 1). To
bodyText ||| provide this experience, we supplement typical TV
bodyText ||| functions with two additional features: TV presence
bodyText ||| information, and the ability to send and receive lightweight
bodyText ||| messages. The features were selected to specifically
bodyText ||| investigate peopleâs behaviors at the boundaries of the
bodyText ||| social television experience, as they begin and end their
bodyText ||| interactions, rather than the details of how they acted while
bodyText ||| fully engaged in the communication experience.
bodyText ||| The prototype is implemented as a PC application running
bodyText ||| on top of GBPVR1 media center software. The system uses
bodyText ||| on-screen displays to communicate which of the userâs
bodyText ||| friends or family (âbuddiesâ) are currently watching, what
bodyText ||| they are watching, and what they have watched in the past.
footnote ||| 1 http://www.gbpvr.com/
footnote ||| The laptop running the Social TV 2 software is connected
footnote ||| to a television, and all interaction with the system is
footnote ||| performed with a standard remote control. For our field
footnote ||| tests we chose to use a TiVoÂ® remote that had several keys
footnote ||| relabeled to correspond to the features of our system.
subsectionHeader ||| TV Presence
bodyText ||| A key requirement for encouraging participation in social
bodyText ||| television is the ability to make users aware of when their
bodyText ||| friends and family are logged into the system and watching
bodyText ||| programs on TV. This information can be viewed from an
bodyText ||| on-screen buddy list (Figure 2). The deployed system has
bodyText ||| two presence states: âwatching TVâ and âawayâ. The âawayâ
bodyText ||| state is intended to inform buddies that a user is not
bodyText ||| currently watching TV. It is set automatically when the TV
bodyText ||| is turned off or when no interactions with the system are
bodyText ||| detected for some time after a program has ended. Users
bodyText ||| can also disconnect from the social component of the
bodyText ||| system if they wish to watch TV in privacy, and will then
bodyText ||| appear to others to be âaway.â However, in this state many
bodyText ||| of the features of the system are disabled, preserving a âsee
bodyText ||| and be seenâ information reciprocity.
bodyText ||| Users can change to the same program that their buddy is
bodyText ||| watching from the buddy list. Additionally, whenever the
bodyText ||| channel is changed, a list of buddies who are also watching
bodyText ||| that program is displayed as part of the transient channel
bodyText ||| information banner.
subsectionHeader ||| Ambient Devices
bodyText ||| While Social TV 2âs on-screen display provides presence
bodyText ||| awareness on the television, we wanted another means to
bodyText ||| convey this information when the TV wasnât on, or when
bodyText ||| users were in a different room and unable to see the TV.
bodyText ||| We chose to use two separate displays capable of
bodyText ||| communicating information unobtrusively, visible from
bodyText ||| anywhere in a room, and which would fit in as household
bodyText ||| objects. The system has two different display devices to
bodyText ||| meet these needs (Figure 3).
figureCaption ||| Figure 2: The Social TV 2 on-screen buddy list.

note ||| CHI 2008 Proceedings Â· Socio-Cultural Impact	April 5-10, 2008 Â· Florence, Italy
figureCaption ||| Figure 3: The orb and Chumby devices displaying a
figureCaption ||| purple color (more than one friend is watching TV).
bodyText ||| As our primary ambient display, we chose the Ambient
bodyText ||| Orb, a color changing lamp from Ambient Devices,2 and
bodyText ||| configured it to display the current number of buddies
bodyText ||| watching television. Different colors are used to indicate
bodyText ||| whether one (blue), more than one (purple), or no other
bodyText ||| buddies (yellow) are currently watching TV.
bodyText ||| The orb was connected via serial cable to our prototype,
bodyText ||| and therefore had to be placed close to the TV. As people
bodyText ||| often spend much of their time outside of the living room
bodyText ||| [1], we wanted to include a second display for times when
bodyText ||| users could not see the primary ambient display. The
bodyText ||| Chumby3 is a WiFi-enabled internet appliance with a 3.5&quot;
bodyText ||| LCD color display Though we would have preferred to use
bodyText ||| a second orb, the Chumby provided faster updates and more
bodyText ||| reliable wireless reception than the orbâs pager-based
bodyText ||| network alternative. We wrote a Flash widget for the
bodyText ||| Chumby that follows the color of the living room orb in
bodyText ||| near-synchronization (within 15 seconds).
bodyText ||| Besides providing information about the number of buddies
bodyText ||| online, we wanted to use the displays to attract users to the
bodyText ||| system when a friend or family member invited them to
bodyText ||| watch a show with them. To signal this, we designed the
bodyText ||| displays to pulse slowly between the current color and
bodyText ||| black. We did not want the flashing to be too distracting,
bodyText ||| but wanted users to notice it so that they could come to their
bodyText ||| televisions if they desired.
subsectionHeader ||| Messaging
bodyText ||| We provided no voice or freeform text communication
bodyText ||| features. However, users can send âsuggestionsâ to invite a
bodyText ||| buddy to watch their current show together. If the buddy
bodyText ||| accepts the suggestion, the system automatically changes
bodyText ||| the channel to that program.
bodyText ||| When two or more buddies are watching the same program,
bodyText ||| the prototype allows them to send messages to each other.
bodyText ||| In the first round of this study, the system allowed only
bodyText ||| three expressions, in the form of graphical thumbs-up,
bodyText ||| thumbs-down, or âshout-outâ emoticons. After this
bodyText ||| deployment, we received feedback that our participants
bodyText ||| wanted to send a wider variety of messages. Therefore, for
footnote ||| 2 http://www.ambientdevices.com/
footnote ||| 3 http://www.chumby.com/
bodyText ||| the second group, we implemented a new feature that
bodyText ||| replaced the generic âshout-outâ message with
bodyText ||| approximately 20 pre-determined messages such as âHow
bodyText ||| is this show?â, âThis sucks!â, or âCall meâ. A number of
bodyText ||| possible replies are available (âGood!â, âBad!â, etc.), as
bodyText ||| well as the thumbs-up and thumbs-down emoticons.
sectionHeader ||| RELATED WORK
subsectionHeader ||| Social Television Systems and Studies
bodyText ||| The idea of communicating and sharing awareness through
bodyText ||| the television set has been explored by a number of
bodyText ||| different researchers. However, social television systems as
bodyText ||| yet remain confined to labs and limited trials. AmigoTV,
bodyText ||| described by Coppens et al. [9], was an early social
bodyText ||| television system that included presence, a buddy list,
bodyText ||| invitations, emoticons, and voice chat, but no facilities for
bodyText ||| indicating presence while offline. Telebuddies, by Luyten et
bodyText ||| al. [21], takes a different approach to the challenge of
bodyText ||| drawing users into the experience, using a friend-of-a-friend
bodyText ||| profile of interests and social relationships to match users
bodyText ||| with suitable communication partners. A more
bodyText ||| comprehensive review of social television systems can be
bodyText ||| found in Harboe et al. [14].
bodyText ||| Geerts [14] and Baillie et al. [2] conducted user studies of
bodyText ||| AmigoTV, both of them lab experiments comparing voice
bodyText ||| communication to other modalities. Weisz et al. [29] and
bodyText ||| Regan and Todd [24] examined groups or pairs of friends
bodyText ||| and strangers using text chat while watching videos or TV
bodyText ||| together. Similarly, Oehlberg et al. studied groups of
bodyText ||| friends and acquaintances watching television, both in
bodyText ||| collocated groups and connected via an audio link [23].
bodyText ||| Finally, In Harboe et al. we examined friends and family
bodyText ||| watching TV in a voice chat setting; this in the participantsâ
bodyText ||| homes rather than the lab [15].
bodyText ||| All these studies were based on single-session events. None
bodyText ||| of them looked at the process by which a shared viewing
bodyText ||| experience is initiated or how the systems are used over
bodyText ||| time. However, Boertjes has announced a prolonged in-
bodyText ||| home study of a social television system called ConnecTV
bodyText ||| [5], and we await those results with interest.
bodyText ||| Building on this existing work, we are extending the social
bodyText ||| television concept by including additional facilities for
bodyText ||| offline awareness of TV presence information. In addition,
bodyText ||| we are presenting results from the field that that throw light
bodyText ||| on the real-world use of television-based sociability, and
bodyText ||| which suggest design considerations for future social
bodyText ||| television systems.
subsectionHeader ||| Social Awareness Systems for the Home
bodyText ||| Hindus et al. created and evaluated a number of social and
bodyText ||| communication systems, with varying levels of media
bodyText ||| richness, for the home [18]. They note that consumers
bodyText ||| wanted devices with multiple communication modes.
bodyText ||| In the context of domestic video calling over the TV,
bodyText ||| Hemmeryckx-Deleersnijder and Thorne integrated an
page ||| 3
note ||| CHI 2008 Proceedings Â· Socio-Cultural Impact	April 5-10, 2008 Â· Florence, Italy
bodyText ||| awareness component that displayed images automatically
bodyText ||| captured from the environment [17]. In their scenario, they
bodyText ||| seek to provide background awareness and help negotiate
bodyText ||| conversation engagement.
bodyText ||| De Ruyter et al. compared different degrees of peripheral
bodyText ||| awareness of remote friends (displayed as video) while
bodyText ||| watching a shared TV program [27]. The system in their
bodyText ||| study only supported awareness while in a shared viewing
bodyText ||| session. Markopoulos et al. provide an overview of other
bodyText ||| awareness systems [22].
subsectionHeader ||| Evaluation of Ambient Displays
bodyText ||| While the ambient display literature contains a wealth of
bodyText ||| design examples, it contains few reports of field
bodyText ||| evaluations. CareNet [8], a combination ambient/interactive
bodyText ||| display for elder care, arrived at a number of useful findings
bodyText ||| for the design of effective ambient displays for the home.
bodyText ||| Rowan et al. showed how an ambient display can foster
bodyText ||| connectedness and promote communication between elders
bodyText ||| and their adult children [26]. In addition to these studies,
bodyText ||| other researchers have shown how ambient displays can
bodyText ||| maintain a sense of connectedness between friends and
bodyText ||| loved ones [12, 28]. The Whereabouts clock [6] shows how
bodyText ||| simple location and messaging capabilities can enhance
bodyText ||| connectedness and allow family members make inferences
bodyText ||| about each othersâ activities using their existing knowledge
bodyText ||| of one another. In this work, we build on these findings to
bodyText ||| demonstrate how ambient displays can be designed into a
bodyText ||| larger social application to promote use of that system and
bodyText ||| fulfill its goals of strengthening social bonds.
sectionHeader ||| METHODS
bodyText ||| In the design of our field study, we were interested to see
bodyText ||| whether the ambient displays met our design goal of
bodyText ||| encouraging social television participation during those
bodyText ||| periods when a participantâs friends and family were also
bodyText ||| using the system, if it led to other forms of communication,
bodyText ||| and how it would ultimately affect the feelings of
bodyText ||| connectedness between our participants. Striving to
bodyText ||| understand these patterns of behavior is an essentially
bodyText ||| qualitative question, and our approach was largely
bodyText ||| exploratory. We ran two separate in-home trials. Five
bodyText ||| households were recruited for each trial, and each trial
bodyText ||| lasted 14 days.
subsectionHeader ||| Recruitment
bodyText ||| Participants were recruited using an independent recruiting
bodyText ||| agency that was instructed to find social groups in which
bodyText ||| the various household members were mutual friends, and
bodyText ||| all had strong ties with one another. The actual relationships
bodyText ||| between the recruited households varied (Figure 4). In both
bodyText ||| trials there was a central âhubâ (A1, B1), a person who
bodyText ||| knew and recruited all the other participants, but there were
bodyText ||| also at least two households who were more peripheral,
bodyText ||| without strong ties to the rest of the group. In both trials the
figureCaption ||| Figure 4: Social ties between households in our field
figureCaption ||| trials. Dashed lines represent acquaintances.
bodyText ||| central hub was a woman, and the four friends she recruited
bodyText ||| female. However, in each group some of the husbands
bodyText ||| knew each other, and in the second group two of the
bodyText ||| husbands were best friends.
bodyText ||| Group A, our first group, consisted of four couples living in
bodyText ||| their own households, two with (very young) children. The
bodyText ||| fifth participant was recently engaged, but still living with
bodyText ||| her parents and brother. Ages of the main participants
bodyText ||| ranged from 26 to 33. A2 and A5 are sisters, and A3 is the
bodyText ||| cousin of A1âs husband. A5 was not friends with anyone
bodyText ||| else in the study except her sister, and A3 and A4 knew
bodyText ||| each other only tangentially from having attended the same
bodyText ||| parties.
bodyText ||| In Group B, our second group, all five nuclear families
bodyText ||| were living in their own households, and all five households
bodyText ||| included teenage children. Ages of the main participants
bodyText ||| ranged from 46 to 53. B1 was very close friends with B2
bodyText ||| and B4, and knew B3 and B5 well. Again we had a pair of
bodyText ||| sisters: B4 and B5, but B2, B3, and B4 only see each other
bodyText ||| at the parties of mutual friends, and B5 did not remember
bodyText ||| ever meeting B2 and B3.
bodyText ||| While there were some husbands in both groups who knew
bodyText ||| each other well, and some of the teenage children in Group
bodyText ||| B knew each other, their relationships, for the most part,
bodyText ||| mirrored those of our female main participants. Thus, we
bodyText ||| had a number of different kinds of relationships represented
bodyText ||| in the two social groups, but neither group was uniformly
bodyText ||| tight-knit.
subsectionHeader ||| Deployment
bodyText ||| For each household, the Social TV 2 system was installed
bodyText ||| in the room participants reported as being the most common
bodyText ||| place for watching TV. As mentioned earlier, Groups A and
bodyText ||| B received slightly different versions of the software, as a
bodyText ||| result of an iterative design process on the basis of Group
bodyText ||| Aâs feedback. Each household was given one orb and one
bodyText ||| Chumby. We asked participants to place the Chumby in any
bodyText ||| part of their home where they spent a significant amount of
bodyText ||| time or passed by frequently. Six participants put it in the
page ||| 4
note ||| CHI 2008 Proceedings Â· Soci-Cultural Impact	April 5-10, 2008 Â· Florence, Italy
bodyText ||| kitchen, two in a hallway, and one in a bedroom. The last
bodyText ||| Chumby malfunctioned and was not used. Participants were
bodyText ||| given a brief (20 minute) introduction to the system and its
bodyText ||| features, and a phone number for technical support that they
bodyText ||| could call at any time. We asked each participant to use the
bodyText ||| system the way they would if they were not in a study, and
bodyText ||| explained that they did not have to use every feature, or any
bodyText ||| feature, unless they wanted to. Other household members
bodyText ||| were also welcome to use the system, and generally did so.
subsectionHeader ||| Data Collection
bodyText ||| We used multiple methods for data collection, including
bodyText ||| interviews, usage logs, and voice mail diaries.
bodyText ||| There were three sets of semi-structured interviews for each
bodyText ||| household. The initial interview lasted about half an hour
bodyText ||| and was used to collect background information. In a phone
bodyText ||| interview after the first week, lasting between 15 and 30
bodyText ||| minutes, we gathered data about the participantsâ use of and
bodyText ||| reactions to the prototype during the first week. And the
bodyText ||| final interview, lasting from an hour to an hour and half,
bodyText ||| was structured to collect more detailed information on a
bodyText ||| number of topics. Whenever possible, we asked other
bodyText ||| household members to participate in the interviews. We
bodyText ||| recorded a total of 22 hours of interview data, but much of
bodyText ||| the material falls outside the scope of this paper.
bodyText ||| We logged all interactions with the system, in order to
bodyText ||| document actual usage and to allow us to examine
bodyText ||| interesting incidents in detail later. The logs, then, provide
bodyText ||| support for some of the events described in the interviews.
bodyText ||| Cameras or sensors in the home would have been useful to
bodyText ||| put the system use in context, but we felt this would be too
bodyText ||| intrusive and technically complex for this study.
bodyText ||| Instead, voice mail diaries were used to collect information
bodyText ||| on behaviors we could neither log nor directly observe, and
bodyText ||| which we were afraid would be forgotten prior to the
bodyText ||| interviews. We devised questions about behaviors
bodyText ||| surrounding the ambient presence/awareness features,
bodyText ||| communications with other people in the study, and their
bodyText ||| reactions to, as well as use of, the various features. So that
bodyText ||| the questions would not influence our participantsâ behavior
bodyText ||| in advance, the participants were given 14 sealed envelopes,
bodyText ||| one for each day of the study, each containing that dayâs
bodyText ||| questions. Thus, participants had the questions in front of
bodyText ||| them as they provided their feedback. Participants left 3
bodyText ||| hours and 41 minutes of voice mail messages in total.
subsectionHeader ||| Analysis
bodyText ||| From the log data we extracted some basic measures of
bodyText ||| system use (Table 1). Given the small scale and non-
bodyText ||| experimental design of the study, we did not attempt further
bodyText ||| statistical treatment of the quantitative data.
bodyText ||| The bulk of the analysis was instead qualitative, using a
bodyText ||| variation of the affinity diagram method. We reviewed the
bodyText ||| interview and voice mail data, and extracted observations,
bodyText ||| statements (which we transcribed) and behavioral
table ||| Activity	A	B

bodyText ||| descriptions relating to ambient presence and awareness.
bodyText ||| These items were printed out as sticky notes.
bodyText ||| Then, working as a team, we put these items together into
bodyText ||| groups or categories, a process of âcomparison, contrast,
bodyText ||| and integrationâ [19]. To efficiently organize the data we
bodyText ||| used an affinity-like post-it chart [4]. Here we followed
bodyText ||| Bernard: As the categories were identified we would âpull
bodyText ||| all the data (that is, exemplars) from those categories
bodyText ||| together and compare them, considering not only what
bodyText ||| [items belong] in each emerging category but also how the
bodyText ||| categories are linked togetherâ [3]. The patterns that
bodyText ||| emerged from this analysis process form the basis of the
bodyText ||| results that follow.
sectionHeader ||| RESULTS
bodyText ||| Our analysis identified several themes around the effect and
bodyText ||| effectiveness of our ambient displays. We first discuss their
bodyText ||| basic ability to communicate presence information, and
bodyText ||| then go on to talk about how they functioned as part of the
bodyText ||| larger Social TV 2 system. Throughout, we use quotes from
bodyText ||| the interviews and voice mail diaries to illustrate each
bodyText ||| particular theme in our participantsâ own words.
subsectionHeader ||| Effectiveness as Ambient Displays
bodyText ||| In considering how the ambient information interacted with
bodyText ||| the other components of the Social TV 2 system, the orb
bodyText ||| and Chumby would only be relevant if they actually
bodyText ||| functioned as ambient displays. Fortunately, they did.
subsubsectionHeader ||| Noticing and interpreting the displays
bodyText ||| Our participants saw and noticed the changing colors of the
bodyText ||| orb, and by and large understood what they signified. B3: âI
bodyText ||| notice when the colorâs on, whether itâs purple or blue, I
bodyText ||| know that someone else is actually on the system.â In fact,
bodyText ||| several participants commented on the orb consistently
bodyText ||| drawing their attention. B 1 mentioned in the final interview
bodyText ||| that âevery time I passed by, a thousand times a day, I
bodyText ||| would look to see what color it was.â Only one participant,
bodyText ||| B4, could not account for the meaning of the different
bodyText ||| colors. When asked if she knew what they signified, she
bodyText ||| answered: â[My daughter] does, I donât.â
bodyText ||| The pulsing signal that the ambient devices sent when a
bodyText ||| suggestion was received was less widely understood. Many
page ||| 5
note ||| CHI 2008 Proceedings Â· Soci-Cultural Impact	April 5-10, 2008 Â· Florence, Italy
bodyText ||| participants confused pulsing with just changing colors. For
bodyText ||| example, B3 said âIâm not sure if it was pulsating or just
bodyText ||| changing purple to blue, to purple to blue [ ... ] I honestly
bodyText ||| donât know...â This may partly have been a problem of
bodyText ||| terminology. More substantially, at least part of the reason
bodyText ||| for the confusion was that few participants saw the pulsing
bodyText ||| happen. Most invitations were sent to people who were
bodyText ||| already watching TV, and who accepted or declined them
bodyText ||| before they had a chance to notice the ambient devices
bodyText ||| pulsing. Another likely contributing factor was the subtlety
bodyText ||| of the signal: âI love the orb, but when it flashes, I wish it
bodyText ||| flashed a different color or did something crazy. I canât tell
bodyText ||| when itâs flashing sometimes.â (A2)
bodyText ||| A number of participants reported that they were less aware
bodyText ||| of the Chumby than of the orb. As B3 said: âI think it&apos;s kind
bodyText ||| of a non-entity, the Chumby.â A few different factors
bodyText ||| appeared to contribute to this. In daylight, the Chumbyâs
bodyText ||| small LCD screen was only clearly readable from certain
bodyText ||| angles, so participants were unable to see it from some
bodyText ||| areas of the room where it was installed. In a few
bodyText ||| households, the Chumby was redundant because
bodyText ||| participants could also see the orb from most places where
bodyText ||| they could see the Chumby. Finally, the Chumbies used
bodyText ||| were pre-production models prone to technical glitches and
bodyText ||| service interruptions, so for nearly all of the participants the
bodyText ||| Chumby did not work properly for parts of the study.
bodyText ||| Nevertheless, the Chumby played an important part of the
bodyText ||| experience for certain participants: For example, A1 told us
bodyText ||| âSince I had [the Chumby] in the kitchen it was just while I
bodyText ||| was cooking...it was like âoh, I wonder whoâs on.â â
subsubsectionHeader ||| Placement
bodyText ||| As noted by others [8, 26], we found that the ambient
bodyText ||| displays needed to be located where they would frequently
bodyText ||| be seen. B1 mentioned, âThe physical positioning in my
bodyText ||| house [for the Chumby] was the perfect spot, because I
bodyText ||| spend most of my day in the kitchen when Iâm home.â In
bodyText ||| two households, participants chose locations for the
bodyText ||| Chumby where they rarely spent time or passed by. âThe
bodyText ||| orb was a lot more helpful than the Chumby. [ ... ] Because
bodyText ||| weâre down here more.â (B2) A5 did not regard the
bodyText ||| displays as particularly useful. This may have been the
bodyText ||| result of physical context, as both were put in her brotherâs
bodyText ||| bedroom. When we asked her if she ever saw the orb go
bodyText ||| purple when she wasnât watching TV, she replied âUh, no,
bodyText ||| because if I was in that room, I knew Iâm gonna be
bodyText ||| watching TV.â
subsubsectionHeader ||| Acceptability of form factor
bodyText ||| The majority of our participants liked the form factor of the
bodyText ||| displays. We received numerous comments such as âI love
bodyText ||| the orbâ (B5), and âI like the orb, I like the Chumby... the
bodyText ||| colors and the blinkingâ (A2). A3 and A4 both called the
bodyText ||| orb âcoolâ and B4 said it was âneat.â Even when the
bodyText ||| novelty of the system wore off and some participants were
bodyText ||| saying that interacting with the on-screen application was a
bodyText ||| âchoreâ (B5), their enjoyment of the orb continued to the
bodyText ||| end. It should be noted that the acceptance wasnât universal;
bodyText ||| A1âs husband complained that the orb did not go with their
bodyText ||| dÃ©cor, but âif it was a little bit smaller I think it would look
bodyText ||| fine.â
subsectionHeader ||| Drawing Users into Communication
bodyText ||| Although the ambient devices provided effective social
bodyText ||| presence, our participants felt that the orb and Chumby
bodyText ||| would not be useful by themselves without the rest of the
bodyText ||| information the Social TV 2 system provided. âIt would be
bodyText ||| pretty, but I couldnât see what people were doing,â said A3.
bodyText ||| B1 commented that âThereâd be no reason to have an orb
bodyText ||| and then I canât turn it on and see who itâs connected to.â
bodyText ||| A2 thought that without the additional information of who
bodyText ||| was watching, and what they were watching, âit would be a
bodyText ||| tease.â Balancing this, several of our participants said that
bodyText ||| at times they were just interested in learning that a friend
bodyText ||| was at home and available, not specifically whether he or
bodyText ||| she was watching television.
bodyText ||| We saw further evidence that the ambient information did
bodyText ||| help to involve them in the social television experience.
bodyText ||| Many of our participants told us of occasions when they
bodyText ||| turned on the TV because the orb indicated that others were
bodyText ||| watching. For example, A2 told us âas soon as I come into
bodyText ||| the house or I wake up or come into the room, thatâs the
bodyText ||| first thing. It draws my attention, and the first thing I do is
bodyText ||| turn on the TV.â In a voice mail, A3 told us that the orb
bodyText ||| âhas made me a little bit more aware, makes me want to,
bodyText ||| when it does change colors, to see which of my buddies are
bodyText ||| on.â
bodyText ||| In some cases the participants switched on the TV just to
bodyText ||| see who was there, then turned it off. However, more often
bodyText ||| they would contact or be contacted by one of their friends,
bodyText ||| or simply go on watching the TV show. A2 told us that she
bodyText ||| would turn on the TV âjust to see whoâs on, and then most
bodyText ||| of the time we would all end up watching the same thing.â
bodyText ||| This usually involved exchanging lightweight messages:
bodyText ||| âFind out what other people are watching, flip to what
bodyText ||| theyâre watching, and then talking to some of the people to
bodyText ||| throw comments out.â (B3)
bodyText ||| In a number of cases, the people who described watching
bodyText ||| TV with their buddies and messaging them were people
bodyText ||| who were doing similar things prior to the study. For
bodyText ||| example, the sisters A2 and A5 told us that they often
bodyText ||| watched TV shows together, and A2 mentioned receiving a
bodyText ||| text message from her sister while they were both watching
bodyText ||| the season finale of Gilmore Girls. Regarding our system,
bodyText ||| she said: âThe first thing I do is see what my buddies are
bodyText ||| watching, and then I tend to sometimes watch what theyâre
bodyText ||| watching and then give suggestions or thumbs up or down
bodyText ||| depending on how I feel toward their program.â
bodyText ||| Interestingly, people who used to watch TV with others
bodyText ||| remotely found themselves doing so again once the Social
bodyText ||| TV 2 system was in their homes. B 1 told us how, years ago,
bodyText ||| she and her close friend B2 would âwatch Saturday Night

bodyText ||| Live together,â while they talked on the phone. However,
bodyText ||| they havenât done anything like that since their children
bodyText ||| were little. Until they participated in this study:
construct ||| âI noticed the orb was blue, so I knew somebody had their
construct ||| television on, and sure enough, it was [B2âs household].
construct ||| And I knew that her husbandâs at work and her kids were at
construct ||| school, so I deduced it was [B2]. And so without even
construct ||| saying âWhoâs there?â I immediately went to her channel,
construct ||| which was Oprah, and I sent her a thumbs-up. And then
construct ||| she thumbs-upped me, and then two seconds later I said [to
construct ||| myself], âThis is dumb!â And then [I called her, and] we
construct ||| had a whole conversation.â
bodyText ||| In this story, we can see that the ambient display serves to
bodyText ||| initially draw the participant into an interaction which then
bodyText ||| becomes progressively deeper, culminating in a direct voice
bodyText ||| conversation. This is a pattern we can see repeated with
bodyText ||| different variations in the logs (Table 2).
bodyText ||| It should be pointed out that although turning the TV on in
bodyText ||| response to the orb was one of the most commonly reported
bodyText ||| behavior patterns in our study, some participants did not
bodyText ||| have a desire to turn on the television and dig deeper into
bodyText ||| the presence information. B3 said: â[The orb is] kind of
bodyText ||| interesting, but once again, what do I care if somebody is
bodyText ||| watching TV?â
bodyText ||| Other participants were curious, but had little interest in
bodyText ||| talking about it. B2âs husband said he would âturn it on just
bodyText ||| to see what theyâre watching, and then probably send them
bodyText ||| a message saying that âit sucksâ or something.â To put this
bodyText ||| in context, he rarely socializes around TV content anyway;
bodyText ||| although B1âs husband is his best friend, he has only once
bodyText ||| been over there to watch TV, for a Super Bowl party.
subsectionHeader ||| Meeting the Goal of Connectedness
bodyText ||| Our participants reported that when they saw the ambient
bodyText ||| colors, they found themselves thinking about the fact that
bodyText ||| others were watching TV. In some cases this translated into
bodyText ||| a feeling that they could âknow whatâs going on,â (B2âs
bodyText ||| husband) with others in the study. Said A3: âI still think the
bodyText ||| orb is kinda the coolest part of the whole thing because itâs
bodyText ||| really neat to see it change color and then know that
bodyText ||| something is going on on the other end to cause it to do
bodyText ||| that.â The husband of A1 said: âEven before I turned on the
bodyText ||| TV, I knew that someone was on there.â B1 put it this way:
bodyText ||| âI liked the different colors, I liked coming in the house and
bodyText ||| saying âoh, someoneâs home watching TV too now.â I donât
bodyText ||| know, it was like a friendly feeling, like someone else is
bodyText ||| home and Iâm not the only one home tonight.â
bodyText ||| While B1 knew all the other participants in her trial, that
bodyText ||| was not true for the others. Participants on the periphery of
bodyText ||| the group could only imagine what it would be like to use
bodyText ||| the system with people closer to them. For example B5,
bodyText ||| who expressed dismay with the system overall, said âitâs a
bodyText ||| love connection. You have feelings for these people and
bodyText ||| you care more. My parents could be blue, my sisters could
bodyText ||| be pink, orange, green.â While B3 did not find the orb
bodyText ||| useful during the study, when she was asked if she would
bodyText ||| be more interested if the orb was telling her about different
bodyText ||| people, she answered:
construct ||| âOh, yeah, yeah, yeah. Probably. If itâs somebody I was
construct ||| closer to. [ ... ] Itâs almost like a communication light
construct ||| bulb. You know what I mean? Like the fire bell goes off,
construct ||| and âDing, ding, ding!â If I saw that, Iâd be âHmm, Dadâs
construct ||| watching,â or, I feel like âHmm, Iâm connecting with
construct ||| somebody.â It sounds so stupid, but maybe youâre
construct ||| connecting with somebody.â
subsectionHeader ||| Inference and Learning about Presence
bodyText ||| Despite the fact that our ambient displays only showed
bodyText ||| three colors, our participants were able to combine the
bodyText ||| information conveyed with previous social knowledge in
bodyText ||| order to draw rich inferences about the other people in the
bodyText ||| study. In some cases it inspired them to leaps of
bodyText ||| imagination, like when B2âs husband saw the orb turn blue
bodyText ||| when someone turned the TV on at 2 am: âI just figured
bodyText ||| somebody was watching, maybe fell asleep on the couch,
bodyText ||| maybe some guy got thrown out of the bedroom for the
bodyText ||| night.â At other times the speculations were more mundane,
bodyText ||| as when B 1 looked at the orb one morning: âThe orb was
bodyText ||| yellow and no one was on, so I&apos;m assuming everyone was
bodyText ||| already at work.â This statement also exemplifies another
bodyText ||| use our participants found for the ambient information:
bodyText ||| Whether or not someone was watching TV was used as a
bodyText ||| proxy for whether they were home. Naturally, the presence
bodyText ||| information in the buddy list was a helpful supplement to
bodyText ||| the ambient devices for this purpose. A5 put it this way:
bodyText ||| âItâd be interesting when Iâd be on at night, like âOh, let me
bodyText ||| see if sheâs on. Is she watching TV, is she home, is she
bodyText ||| out?â So that was one way to know, âYeah, sheâs home,
bodyText ||| sheâs watching TV.â â
bodyText ||| We saw evidence that over the course of the study, our
bodyText ||| participants learned more about each otherâs viewing habits,
bodyText ||| and used that knowledge to interpret the ambient signals
bodyText ||| with more confidence, guessing who might be on at any
bodyText ||| given time. Most of our participants knew little about the
bodyText ||| TV viewing habits of the rest of their group before the
bodyText ||| study commenced. To take just one example, A1 was only
bodyText ||| able to make general guesses about her friendsâ viewing
bodyText ||| habits when the study started. At the end, on the other hand,
bodyText ||| she told us: âYeah, I think as the two weeks progressed I
bodyText ||| kinda had a feel; like on Fridays I know [A4] works from
page ||| 7
note ||| CHI 2008 Proceedings Â· Soci-Cultural Impact	April 5-10, 2008 Â· Florence, Italy
bodyText ||| home so, like, this past Friday the light was blue, and I was
bodyText ||| like âthe only person whoâs going to be watching TV right
bodyText ||| now is her.â So I kinda got a feel. Late night would be [A5],
bodyText ||| daytime would be [A3] because of the kids.â
bodyText ||| By allowing participants to leverage their existing
bodyText ||| knowledge of one another to learn more detail about their
bodyText ||| viewing habits, the ambient information conveyed by Social
bodyText ||| TV 2 became more powerful. Participants were soon able to
bodyText ||| use the orb to glean (with some degree of uncertainty)
bodyText ||| information that they had initially needed to look up in the
bodyText ||| buddy list. One indication of the meaning that our
bodyText ||| participants attributed to the ambient devicesâ output is the
bodyText ||| power the displays had to puzzle them. When B1 sat down
bodyText ||| to watch TV on a rainy evening, she noted to her surprise
bodyText ||| that no one else was logged on: âThe oddest thing, itâs a
bodyText ||| nice night to be in... and not one person is on Social TV
bodyText ||| tonight!â
bodyText ||| Presence seemed to lead to an expectation that someone
bodyText ||| who was watching TV was available for interaction.
bodyText ||| Unfortunately, our participants were often disappointed. B2
bodyText ||| told us in a voice mail: âWeâve not really heard back from
bodyText ||| people, the orb is blue, I donât know if theyâre getting them
bodyText ||| or if theyâre just not sending back or what the problem is.â
bodyText ||| In the phone interview she said that when people werenât
bodyText ||| responding, perhaps âthey just wanted to watch their show,
bodyText ||| and they were ignoring you.â B1 said that when she notices
bodyText ||| the orb turning blue or purple and turns on the TV, she felt
bodyText ||| like âtheyâre on for a few minutes, we say hello, and then
bodyText ||| someone turns it off or they have to go.â
sectionHeader ||| DISCUSSION
subsectionHeader ||| An Integral Component of Social TV 2
bodyText ||| If we consider the ambient devices in isolation, they appear
bodyText ||| as fairly ordinary displays for peripheral presence
bodyText ||| awareness. And indeed, the results show that they
bodyText ||| successfully functioned as such. This, along with the fact
bodyText ||| that the orb, at least, was on the whole so well liked, goes
bodyText ||| some way towards validating our design, but it is not by
bodyText ||| itself a particularly novel finding. Far more interesting are
bodyText ||| the ways in which the ambient devices and the other Social
bodyText ||| TV 2 features interacted. Our findings reveal and hint at a
bodyText ||| number of interesting behaviors emerging, and these are
bodyText ||| particularly relevant to the design and understanding of
bodyText ||| future social systems in the home.
bodyText ||| Our system was designed so that the ambient devices only
bodyText ||| worked while the Social TV 2 client remained connected to
bodyText ||| the network. And as we have noted, people, in general,
bodyText ||| liked the ambient lights, both because of the information
bodyText ||| they provided and for the aesthetic appeal. Although the
bodyText ||| design of our study didnât allow us to conclusively test this,
bodyText ||| it does seem to indicate that the ambient devices would
bodyText ||| therefore encourage people to stay logged on, and serve as a
bodyText ||| reminder, if they ever do leave, to return as soon as
bodyText ||| possible, thereby ensuring the presence conduit remains
bodyText ||| open.
bodyText ||| The orb and the Chumby were effective at conveying when
bodyText ||| other people were watching TV, and this allowed our
bodyText ||| participants to be aware of othersâ availability even when
bodyText ||| their own TV sets were turned off and they were engaged in
bodyText ||| other activities. In this way, it reduced the risk of an
bodyText ||| opportunity for interaction going by unnoticed.
bodyText ||| Together, these effects expand the interface between the
bodyText ||| system and the environment. For one thing, the chances of
bodyText ||| making contact are greatly increased. Also, the social
bodyText ||| television experience is no longer something that only takes
bodyText ||| place during the time you are actually watching TV. The
bodyText ||| ambient devices keep users engaged with the system while
bodyText ||| they go about other activities, thereby creating an âout-of-
bodyText ||| the-boxâ social experience.
subsectionHeader ||| Multiple Levels of Engagement
bodyText ||| Our findings indicate that while it extended the social
bodyText ||| experience beyond the TV, the awareness provided by the
bodyText ||| ambient displays also helped draw our participants into the
bodyText ||| television experience and encourage them to use the
bodyText ||| system. This result supports previous efforts to use
bodyText ||| peripheral social awareness to lower the barriers to
bodyText ||| communication [17, 11].
bodyText ||| We can generalize the steps reported by our users (and
bodyText ||| corroborated by the logs): the participants become aware of
bodyText ||| their friendsâ availability through the ambient devices, turn
bodyText ||| on their TV (thereby themselves showing up as available to
bodyText ||| the other participants), look at their buddy list, and either
bodyText ||| join what one of their friends were watching or suggest that
bodyText ||| their friend join them. Once they were viewing together,
bodyText ||| they would usually send messages or emoticons, and
bodyText ||| sometimes this would culminate with a phone call. From
bodyText ||| this idealized flow, we can define different stages of
bodyText ||| interaction (Table 3). This can be viewed as an extension of
bodyText ||| Eggen et al.âs three interaction states [13].
bodyText ||| We can see that as we move down the levels, the user
bodyText ||| becomes progressively more engaged with the experience,
bodyText ||| going from peripheral presence awareness to immersive
bodyText ||| participation through a number of intermediate levels. Part
bodyText ||| of the reason for this is that at each stage, the user has
bodyText ||| access to more detailed information. This is similar to a
bodyText ||| âramping interfaceâ model of information design and
bodyText ||| interaction [25], and allows users to drill down to the level
bodyText ||| they are interested in. In particular, each step provides more
bodyText ||| specific presence and richer contextual awareness. The
bodyText ||| ambient device provides only aggregate presence, and only
bodyText ||| conveys that a TV is on. The buddy list shows presence per
bodyText ||| household, and what they are watching. By watching the
bodyText ||| same thing, common ground is established, and by
bodyText ||| communicating it is possible to identify the other person at
bodyText ||| an individual level. However, the most interesting thing to
bodyText ||| note may be that as users become more deeply engaged,
bodyText ||| they also become increasingly present to, and eventually
bodyText ||| connected to, their buddies.

bodyText ||| Users can move freely between the various interaction
bodyText ||| levels, as their needs and interest dictate. However, each
bodyText ||| stage provides impulses that encourage deeper engagement,
bodyText ||| playing on such traits as curiosity and desire to express
bodyText ||| opinions, and guides users towards the ultimate state of live
bodyText ||| conversation, which here takes the form of phone calls.
subsectionHeader ||| Improving the Quality of Time Spent Watching TV
bodyText ||| We see that the ambient information is intimately bound up
bodyText ||| with the social functionality available on the TV. Although
bodyText ||| our participants found the ambient data interesting in the
bodyText ||| context of the Social TV 2 system, the information would
bodyText ||| be nearly meaningless on its own; âa tease.â If the ambient
bodyText ||| displays extend the social television experience outside of
bodyText ||| the TV set, the other features help users interpret the
bodyText ||| ambient signals and provide the information with a purpose.
bodyText ||| They make it actionable.
bodyText ||| Furthermore, as social presence information is made
bodyText ||| actionable through the TV, turning on the TV becomes
bodyText ||| redefined as a social act: âEven before I turned on the TV, I
bodyText ||| knew that someone was on there.â Because the ambient
bodyText ||| devices provide users with at least peripheral awareness of
bodyText ||| their buddiesâ presence information, there is now an
bodyText ||| unavoidable social dimension to pressing that button, such
bodyText ||| as expectations of availability. And even if users should be
bodyText ||| oblivious, turning on the TV affects their buddiesâ ambient
bodyText ||| displays and presence view, making them aware. We saw
bodyText ||| this social consideration give rise to new behaviors such as
bodyText ||| turning on the TV when the ambient devices showed other
bodyText ||| people online.
bodyText ||| The methods of our study do not allow us to say with
bodyText ||| confidence whether Social TV 2 caused our participants to
bodyText ||| watch more TV, or keep their TV on more. For that, a
bodyText ||| control condition would be required. Certainly some of our
bodyText ||| findings suggest that it might be the case. However, in light
bodyText ||| of the above, direct comparisons may not be particularly
bodyText ||| meaningful. To watch Social TV 2 is not merely to
bodyText ||| consume entertainment, but to engage in communication
bodyText ||| with friends and family that can bring you closer together,
bodyText ||| reaffirm social ties, and let you get to know each other
bodyText ||| better. The ambient displays provide a first point of contact
bodyText ||| for TV-based conversations, and help establish a social
bodyText ||| mindset around the very notion of television.
bodyText ||| This insight suggests that different systems could use
bodyText ||| ambient displays to emphasize specific features, by
bodyText ||| preparing the userâs frame of mind in advance of their
bodyText ||| active interactions.
sectionHeader ||| CONCLUSIONS
bodyText ||| In this paper we have presented results from testing a social
bodyText ||| television system with an ambient component for social
bodyText ||| presence. On the whole, our participants liked the idea of
bodyText ||| having the TV watching activities of their social groups
bodyText ||| represented in ambient displays. Presence information was
bodyText ||| understood and used as a proxy for who was home and
bodyText ||| available. More importantly, it worked to support the
bodyText ||| experience of communicating through the television.
bodyText ||| Most social television research to date has focused on what
bodyText ||| happens once people are engaged in a social television
bodyText ||| experience. There has been little research into how such
bodyText ||| sessions would be initiated, and how they can be made to fit
bodyText ||| into the context of everyday activities. Our study addresses
bodyText ||| these issues: Designs based on ambient displays offer a
bodyText ||| credible answer, and our field study showed one such
bodyText ||| design to perform well in practice. Since the same concerns
bodyText ||| are relevant to a wide class of other in-home social systems,
bodyText ||| this finding holds more general interest.
sectionHeader ||| FUTURE WORK
bodyText ||| One of the most interesting questions raised by this study is
bodyText ||| how the addition of social awareness will affect pre-existing
bodyText ||| patterns of behavior around TV viewing. The effect is
bodyText ||| profound, and some simple examples are clearly evident in
bodyText ||| the data. However, we suspect that the altered social
bodyText ||| dynamic of TV viewing could have far more complex and
bodyText ||| subtle effects, especially as the presence awareness
bodyText ||| increases the visibility of TV viewing habits to oneself and
page ||| 9
note ||| CHI 2008 Proceedings Â· Soci-Cultural Impact	April 5-10, 2008 Â· Florence, Italy
bodyText ||| others. Understanding these changes in perception and
bodyText ||| behavior is a rich area for further research.
bodyText ||| While our data collection provided a great deal of
bodyText ||| qualitative information on how participants used Social TV
bodyText ||| 2, we have no data on when participants were home, when
bodyText ||| they were in a room from which they could observe the
bodyText ||| ambient indicators, or who was using the system at any
bodyText ||| particular moment in time. This limits our ability to
bodyText ||| interpret the log data. In upcoming studies we plan to
bodyText ||| include a control condition, to provide a baseline against
bodyText ||| which changes in behavior can be detected.
bodyText ||| We continue to iterate on the design of the Social TV
bodyText ||| prototype. Given the tendency of our participants to seek
bodyText ||| progressively deeper engagement and richer
bodyText ||| communication, we have now integrated support for voice
bodyText ||| and text chatting, and are currently preparing another field
bodyText ||| trial with these features included. We are also considering
bodyText ||| other form factors for the ambient devices, and changing
bodyText ||| the kinds of information these devices display. However,
bodyText ||| one change we are not going to make is eliminating the
bodyText ||| ambient information. Our findings spoke clearly to us about
bodyText ||| the attractive nature of ambient awareness, and we intend to
bodyText ||| keep using this feature to promote TV-based sociability.
