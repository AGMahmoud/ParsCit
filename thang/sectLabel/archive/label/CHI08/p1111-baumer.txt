sectionHeader ||| ABSTRACT
bodyText ||| Within the last decade, blogs have become an important
bodyText ||| element of popular culture, mass media, and the daily lives
bodyText ||| of countless Internet users. Despite the mediumâs
bodyText ||| interactive nature, most research on blogs focuses on either
bodyText ||| the blog itself or the blogger, rarely if at all focusing on the
bodyText ||| readerâs impact. In order to gain a better understanding of
bodyText ||| the social practice of blogging, we must take into account
bodyText ||| the role, contributions, and significance of the reader. This
bodyText ||| paper presents the findings of a qualitative study of blog
bodyText ||| readers, including common blog reading practices, some of
bodyText ||| the dimensions along which reading practices vary,
bodyText ||| relationships between identity presentation and perception,
bodyText ||| the interpretation of temporality, and the ways in which
bodyText ||| readers feel that they are a part of the blogs they read. It
bodyText ||| also describes similarities to, and discrepancies with,
bodyText ||| previous work, and suggests a number of directions and
bodyText ||| implications for future work on blogging.

sectionHeader ||| INTRODUCTION
bodyText ||| By most indications, blogs are proliferating at an ever-
bodyText ||| increasing rate. Although specific figures vary among
bodyText ||| different sources [16,25] there is consensus that blogs have
bodyText ||| become an important, active, and influential part of online
bodyText ||| media. Research on blogging, e.g., [11,15,21], has revealed
bodyText ||| important insights about the activity of blogging, the
bodyText ||| attitudes of bloggers, and the practices surrounding blogs.
bodyText ||| However, blogging is not a solo activity. While work has
bodyText ||| been done in areas such as analyzing conversations between

bodyText ||| blogs, e.g., [7,10], and applying social network analysis to
bodyText ||| blogs, e.g., [8,19], little work has been done examining the
bodyText ||| role of the reader in the blogging process. This gap is
bodyText ||| surprising, considering Nardi et al.âs prediction that âfuture
bodyText ||| research is sure to pay attention to blog readersâ [21:231].
bodyText ||| Furthermore, according to Lenhart and Fox [16], as of July
bodyText ||| 2006, 57 million American adults read blogs, over a third of
bodyText ||| the 147 million who use the Internet. Sifry [25] puts the
bodyText ||| number of unique Technorati visitors at over 9 million in
bodyText ||| March 2007, up by over 50% from February 2007. Clearly,
bodyText ||| not only is the number of blogs increasing, but also the
bodyText ||| number of blog readers. The role of this ever increasing
bodyText ||| population of blog readers presents a promising and
bodyText ||| important, yet little-explored, area of research.
bodyText ||| This paper is not the first call for a focus on readers. In the
bodyText ||| 1960âs and 1970âs, a shift occurred in literary theory from
bodyText ||| focusing primarily on the literary object itself to including
bodyText ||| the readerâs response to the literature. Reader-response
bodyText ||| theory, or reader-response criticism, cf. [3,17], focuses not
bodyText ||| on the literature itself but rather on the audienceâs response
bodyText ||| to, and interpretation of, the text. The reader is not a passive
bodyText ||| recipient of content, this critique argues, but rather engages
bodyText ||| in an active process of interpretation. Reality and meaning
bodyText ||| exist neither solely in the text nor solely in the reader, but
bodyText ||| are constructed through the dialectic interactions between
bodyText ||| the two. Similarly, the reality and meaning of a blog exists
bodyText ||| neither solely in the blog itself nor solely in the reader, but
bodyText ||| rather in the readerâs active interpretation of, and
bodyText ||| interaction with, the blog. Furthermore, technologies and
bodyText ||| practices such as commenting, linking, tagging, and
bodyText ||| trackbacks enable a level of explicit interaction with both
bodyText ||| the text and the author not available in previous textual
bodyText ||| media. This paper argues for a shift in the study of blogging
bodyText ||| similar to that in literary criticism represented by reader-
bodyText ||| response theory. This shift to emphasize the interactional
bodyText ||| aspects of blogging also fits into a larger trend in HCI
bodyText ||| research of moving from the user as information processor,
bodyText ||| to human actor, to embodied experiencer [5]. In order to
bodyText ||| understand the myriad contexts in which human-computer
bodyText ||| interaction takes place, researchers have adopted different
bodyText ||| stances toward users and taken different perspectives on
bodyText ||| HCI systems. Similarly, in order to understand fully the
bodyText ||| activity of blogging, we must study not only bloggers and
bodyText ||| the blogs they produce, but also the readers of those blogs
bodyText ||| and their interactions with the blog and the blogger.

bodyText ||| This paper reports on the results of a qualitative study into
bodyText ||| the practices and culture of blog readers. How do readers
bodyText ||| contribute to and help shape the various blogs they read?
bodyText ||| When, why, and how do readers choose to comment? How
bodyText ||| do readers perceive the identity of the blogger? Do readers
bodyText ||| feel overwhelmed by the amount of information available
bodyText ||| through blogs? What habits do readers follow? While this
bodyText ||| paper cannot address these questions in their entirety, it is a
bodyText ||| first step toward understanding the role, contributions, and
bodyText ||| significance of the reader in the activity of blogging.
sectionHeader ||| RELATED WORK
bodyText ||| Recent work on blogging covers a wide range of topics (see
bodyText ||| [24] for an overview). This section highlights work that
bodyText ||| helps inform this study. Nardi [21] examined the social
bodyText ||| nature of blogging activity, illustrating that blogs are quite
bodyText ||| unlike a personal diary. Lenhartâs [15] work pointed to the
bodyText ||| slow development of norms given the decentralized and
bodyText ||| non-standardized activities that occur on and off blogs.
bodyText ||| Herring et al. [11] provide a genre analysis of weblogs.
bodyText ||| Within the emerging medium of blogs, boyd [1] addressed
bodyText ||| the need for self-awareness tools to manage the fluidity of
bodyText ||| identity presentation in blogs. Some have applied existing
bodyText ||| analytic tools, such as social network analysis, e.g., [8, 19],
bodyText ||| to show that blogs are not highly interconnected in a
bodyText ||| decentralized fashion, but rather grouped in numerous
bodyText ||| clusters of blogs with limited links between clusters.
bodyText ||| Studies using conversation analysis have suggested that
bodyText ||| conversations across blogs and amongst bloggers are
bodyText ||| limited to a small number of âA-listâ blogs [10].
bodyText ||| Here, our focus is the audience. In Lenhartâs examination of
bodyText ||| norm formation in blogging [15], she discusses the
bodyText ||| anonymity of the blog audience and their occasional
bodyText ||| terrifying effect on bloggers. Similarly, Reed [23] illustrates
bodyText ||| blogger self-censorship due to an audience made up of
bodyText ||| certain friends and family. boyd [2] describes the
bodyText ||| expectations that bloggers feel are placed on them by their
bodyText ||| audience and how bloggers negotiate the formation and
bodyText ||| fulfillment of these expectations. Nardi suggests that
bodyText ||| âreaders create blogs as much as writersâ [21:225], giving
bodyText ||| them an equal role in the activity of blogging. Despite
bodyText ||| acknowledging the presence and impact of an audience, no
bodyText ||| previous blogging research has made blog readers the
bodyText ||| primary focus. This paper aims to fill that gap.
bodyText ||| The position of the blog reader is often an ambiguous one.
bodyText ||| Most research on blogs adopts the view that readers,
bodyText ||| commenters, and participants are also bloggers themselves,
bodyText ||| e.g., [8]. However, according to the statistics cited above,
bodyText ||| there is obviously a large discrepancy between bloggers and
bodyText ||| people who read blogs â not every reader is a blogger. The
bodyText ||| question becomes, when does one move from being a blog
bodyText ||| reader to a blogger? Is simply owning a blog enough, or
bodyText ||| must there be regular updates? What is the requisite update
bodyText ||| frequency? Despite indications to the contrary, are there
bodyText ||| any bloggers who do not read other blogs? It is be argued
bodyText ||| below that, rather than attempting to split individuals into
bodyText ||| either the category of blogger or the category of reader, it
bodyText ||| might be more useful to consider the question in terms of
bodyText ||| degree of membership, where an individual may be both a
bodyText ||| blogger and a reader to varying and independent degrees.
bodyText ||| For the purposes of this study, we focus on those who have
bodyText ||| a high enough degree of readership to self-identify as a blog
bodyText ||| reader, regardless of their degree of bloggership.
sectionHeader ||| THEORY
bodyText ||| In examining the activities that surround blog reading, this
bodyText ||| study is partially informed by ideas from reader-response
bodyText ||| theory [3,17], which help provide a general framework with
bodyText ||| which to analyze the act of reading blogs. This section
bodyText ||| provides a brief introduction to reader-response theory,
bodyText ||| situating it in the context of literary criticism, and describes
bodyText ||| how the theory is applied in this paper.
bodyText ||| Despite the general inclination to situate reader-response
bodyText ||| theory in opposition to formalism, which posits that only
bodyText ||| the materiality of the text is significant, it actually
bodyText ||| developed from within formalism itself (Tompkins, cited in
bodyText ||| [3]). In the 1950âs, reader-response theory branched out
bodyText ||| from formalist discourse under the auspices of Gibsonâs
bodyText ||| âmock readerâ â the persona a reader should adopt to
bodyText ||| understand the text [3]. Thus a slight variation within
bodyText ||| formalism became the seed from which the reader and her
bodyText ||| or his interpretation gained significance.
bodyText ||| Later reader-response theorists, such as Crosman [3],
bodyText ||| argued specifically that the âconstruction of meaning
bodyText ||| ultimately resides in the auspices of readers, who approach
bodyText ||| literary texts... from their own subjective perspectivesâ
bodyText ||| [3:66]. This view is reminiscent of Nardi et al.âs [21]
bodyText ||| assertion that the reader and writer both participate in co-
bodyText ||| creating the blog, as well as Dourishâs [5] emphasis on
bodyText ||| viewing the user as a situated, embodied actor that actively
bodyText ||| engages with a system in context. As an extension of
bodyText ||| Crosmanâs approach, Lewis [17] presents an alternate
bodyText ||| method of performing a literary critique. He suggests rather
bodyText ||| than judging books as good or bad and making assertions
bodyText ||| about someoneâs tastes based on the books he or she reads,
bodyText ||| âlet us try to discover how far it might be plausible to
bodyText ||| define a good book as a book which is read in one way, and
bodyText ||| a bad book as a book which is read in another wayâ [16:1].
bodyText ||| He argues that âgood literature [is] that which permits,
bodyText ||| invites, or even compels good readingâ [16:104], and that
bodyText ||| examining the type of reading that a given work permits,
bodyText ||| invites, or compels can tell you about the merits of that
bodyText ||| work. While there may be questions as to what constitutes
bodyText ||| good reading, the purpose at hand is not to separate good
bodyText ||| blogs from bad. Rather, it is to explore the extent to which
bodyText ||| we may understand a blog not by features of its content,
bodyText ||| structure, or technological aspects, but rather by the type of
bodyText ||| reading practices in which readers of the blog engage.
sectionHeader ||| METHODS
bodyText ||| The authors chose to employ qualitative and ethnographic
bodyText ||| methods in order to gain an understanding of the subjective
page ||| 1112
note ||| CHI 2008 Proceedings Â· Shared Authoring	April 5-10, 2008 Â· Florence, Italy
bodyText ||| experience of reading blogs. Participants were recruited
bodyText ||| through physical fliers posted on community bulletin
bodyText ||| boards and in public posting areas, as well as through
bodyText ||| online bulletin boards for the local community. The posted
bodyText ||| criteria were that respondents read at least 5 different blogs
bodyText ||| at least 2 to 3 times per week. In total, 23 individuals
bodyText ||| replied to these advertisements: 21 responded to the
bodyText ||| physical fliers, and 2 replied to the online postings. Of
bodyText ||| those, 19 fit our criteria (18 from the physical fliers and 1
bodyText ||| from the online postings). Some potential subjects decided
bodyText ||| not to participate or stopped responding, resulting in a total
bodyText ||| of 15 respondents. All participants were compensated up to
bodyText ||| $20 US depending on the extent of their participation.
bodyText ||| Participant names used in this paper are pseudonyms.
bodyText ||| Three main data-gathering techniques were used: two semi-
bodyText ||| structured interviews with each participant, logging
bodyText ||| software to track reading patterns, and a survey to gather
bodyText ||| some basic data, such as demographics. Since there is little
bodyText ||| focus on blog readers in the existing literature, the first set
bodyText ||| of interviews were largely exploratory and generative;
bodyText ||| although there were specific themes on which this study
bodyText ||| was to focus, the first interview was also used to find other
bodyText ||| interesting themes or issues in our respondentsâ blog
bodyText ||| reading practices. During the second interviews,
bodyText ||| participants were asked to discuss further some of the
bodyText ||| specific themes that emerged during the first round of
bodyText ||| interviews. Participants were also solicited to complete their
bodyText ||| second interview as a group interview. Four participants
bodyText ||| expressed interest in group interviews, but due to logistic
bodyText ||| constraints only one pair of participants completed the
bodyText ||| second interview as a group. One participant, Connie was
bodyText ||| unable to complete the second interview, and another, Jill,
bodyText ||| had to answer questions for the second interview via email.
bodyText ||| During both interviews, all participants spent time reading
bodyText ||| blogs as they normally would, showing and describing
bodyText ||| items of interest and parts of their blog-reading routines to
bodyText ||| the interviewer. All interviews and notes were transcribed
bodyText ||| and coded, initially using open coding and then
bodyText ||| transitioning to axial coding (see [18]). Coding was an
bodyText ||| iterative process during which two of the authors
bodyText ||| independently coded each interview transcript and then
bodyText ||| exchanged the transcripts to confer on the codes used and
bodyText ||| the themes they represented. The initial coding began after
bodyText ||| the completion of the first interviews, so that results from
bodyText ||| analysis of the first set of interviews helped inform and
bodyText ||| direct the second set. The axial codes form the basis for the
bodyText ||| findings reported below.
bodyText ||| Participants were also asked to install logging software on
bodyText ||| their computers to track their blog reading. The logger was
bodyText ||| implemented as a plugin for IBMâs Web Intermediaries
bodyText ||| infrastructure [28], which recorded a series of time-stamped
bodyText ||| URLs. Unfortunately, most participants either elected not to
bodyText ||| install the logger or ran into technical difficulties. Since
bodyText ||| only five participants successfully ran the logger, an
bodyText ||| analysis of those logs is not presented here, but it was used
bodyText ||| to generate questions for some of the second interviews.
sectionHeader ||| FINDINGS AND DISCUSSION
bodyText ||| Table 1 presents a profile of our respondents. Because
bodyText ||| subjects were recruited from the geographical area around a
bodyText ||| university, many are students or recent graduates. That said,
bodyText ||| they represent a diverse set of blog reading habits and
bodyText ||| practices. The data presented in this table were collected
bodyText ||| through an online survey completed by all but one of the
bodyText ||| participants (Connie). âRegular blogsâ is the number of
bodyText ||| blogs the participant reads on a regular basis as determined
bodyText ||| by the participant, âexample blogsâ are a selection of
bodyText ||| representative examples from the blogs she or he reads, and
bodyText ||| âtoolsâ describes the technology the participant uses to find
bodyText ||| and to read blogs. Since the purpose of these data is not to
bodyText ||| make statistical inferences about blog readers but rather to
bodyText ||| help create a picture of the various participants, and since
bodyText ||| the sample is not sufficiently large to generate statistically
bodyText ||| significant results, no quantitative analysis is performed.
bodyText ||| For statistics about blog readers, see [16].
bodyText ||| This section includes a description of blog reading practices
bodyText ||| that were common among most of our participants, along
bodyText ||| with some of the factors that influence the myriad
bodyText ||| differences in approaches to reading blogs. Drawing on this
bodyText ||| diversity in blog reading practices, the section then
bodyText ||| addresses the question âwhat is a blog?â from readersâ
bodyText ||| perspectives; discusses the presentation and perception of
bodyText ||| online identity, noting important similarities and differences
bodyText ||| with previous work; and describes ways in which readers
bodyText ||| can feel that they are âa partâ of the blogs they read.
subsectionHeader ||| Common Blog Reading Practices
bodyText ||| While reader-response theory helps make sense of the
bodyText ||| significant variations of the data, some aspects of our
bodyText ||| participantsâ reading practices are fairly consistent. Thirteen
bodyText ||| explicitly stated that blog reading is a form of âchilling
bodyText ||| outâ, âwasting timeâ, âbrain candyâ, or âdoing nothingâ,
bodyText ||| similar to the pottering activities described by Wyche et al.
bodyText ||| [27]. The other two later indicated on the survey that blog
bodyText ||| reading was âsometimesâ an activity during periods of
bodyText ||| boredom. Similar to some instances of pottering, blog
bodyText ||| reading can also have a habitual nature. When Fern reads
bodyText ||| blogs, she adheres to a self-prescribed system, despite her
bodyText ||| lack of interest in the content of some posts she reads.
bodyText ||| Lillian indicated that reading blogs became part of her
bodyText ||| morning routine. When we asked Charles if he looked
bodyText ||| forward to reading blogs everyday he responded:
construct ||| I donât know if I look forward to [reading blogs]... I donât
construct ||| really look forward to cigarettes anymore, but itâs something
construct ||| that happens through the course of the day that I feel like I
construct ||| might need to do. It just becomes habit, I guess.
bodyText ||| Though in all likelihood most blog readers do not share
bodyText ||| Charlesâs outlook on the intensity of blog readingâs
bodyText ||| addictiveness, blog reading often becomes habitual. For
bodyText ||| Krish, who has only been reading blogs for eight months,
bodyText ||| âchecking blogs is like checking oneâs email,â which is
bodyText ||| similar to the habitualness described by nine other
bodyText ||| participants. For many, checking email is a routine, almost

bodyText ||| quintessential part of going online. Whether one expects an
bodyText ||| email or not is unimportant, because one will check her or
bodyText ||| his email account not with the expectation of receiving
bodyText ||| email but rather as part of an Internet ritual.
bodyText ||| Much work in information retrieval, search technologies,
bodyText ||| and related fields is based on the premise that the sheer
bodyText ||| volume of information available is simply overwhelming,
bodyText ||| often referred to as âinformation overload,â and that users
bodyText ||| feel compelled to try and stay on top of the ever increasing
bodyText ||| amount of available information. This attitude dates at least
bodyText ||| as far back as Barnaby Richâs assertion, in 1613, that âone
bodyText ||| of the diseases of this age is the multiplicity of books; they
bodyText ||| doth so overcharge the world that it is not able to digest the
bodyText ||| abundance of idle matter that is every day hatched and
bodyText ||| brought forth into the worldâ (quoted in [4:63]). However,
bodyText ||| such a sense of information overload with respect to blogs
bodyText ||| was not common among our respondents. Only two of the
bodyText ||| fifteen, Charles and Lillian, expressed feeling overwhelmed
bodyText ||| by the potential information available through blogs. The
bodyText ||| other participants indicated that they are not bothered when
bodyText ||| they cannot stay current with the newest posts for the blogs
bodyText ||| they frequent. Some would eventually catch up on old posts
bodyText ||| when the time suited them, while others simply choose the
bodyText ||| most recent or most interesting posts to read, skipping the
bodyText ||| rest. Laura reveals, âI donât kill myself over it, because itâs
bodyText ||| not like I canât always go back and see, âokay what
bodyText ||| happened two weeks agoâ ... I know whatâs there and I
bodyText ||| know where to find it when I need it.â This attitude
bodyText ||| challenges the commonly accepted notion that users feel
bodyText ||| overwhelmed with staying constantly up to date.
bodyText ||| It also raises interesting issues of synchronicity. Computer
bodyText ||| mediated communication is often considered either
bodyText ||| synchronous, e.g., live video or audio chat; near
bodyText ||| synchronous, e.g., instant messaging; or asynchronous, e.g.,
bodyText ||| email. Clearly, there are not fine distinctions but rather a
bodyText ||| gradient from synchronous to asynchronous, and blogs are
bodyText ||| generally placed closer to the asynchronous end of the
bodyText ||| spectrum [21]. However, based on our participantsâ
bodyText ||| descriptions, they do not read blogs in a temporally situated
bodyText ||| manner. When returning to a blog that has not been visited
bodyText ||| recently, it does not matter if the most recent three posts
bodyText ||| occurred in the past week, in the past day, or in the past
bodyText ||| hour. What matters is the order in which posts appear on the
bodyText ||| blog. The most recent post on one blog, even if it is several
page ||| 1114
note ||| CHI 2008 Proceedings Â· Shared Authoring	April 5-10, 2008 Â· Florence, Italy
bodyText ||| days old, is more likely to be read than the fourth post down
bodyText ||| on another blog, even if that post is from the previous day.
bodyText ||| This is somewhat similar to instant messaging
bodyText ||| conversations where time lapses between turns do not
bodyText ||| necessarily have an impact on the conversation [22]. Here,
bodyText ||| we introduce the term non-chronous to describe practices
bodyText ||| where individual events in one context, here a single blog,
bodyText ||| are considered in the temporal order in which they
bodyText ||| occurred, but not with regard to the specific time at which
bodyText ||| they occurred. This non-chronous approach does not mean
bodyText ||| that time-date stamps are utterly ineffectual, but they
bodyText ||| become much less important, especially with the advent of
bodyText ||| RSS aggregators, email clients, blog-host subscription lists,
bodyText ||| etc. For example, when Matthew falls behind on his regular
bodyText ||| blogs, he reads the five or so most recent posts in his RSS
bodyText ||| reader and his friendsâ blogs. Patricia notes the time-
bodyText ||| stampâs existence in passing, but does not take it into
bodyText ||| account while reading. Generally, participants in this study
bodyText ||| do not see themselves as struggling to handle a deluge of
bodyText ||| information streaming through blogsâa missed post is not
bodyText ||| usually a missed opportunity.
bodyText ||| Stepping back from the details of common blog reading
bodyText ||| practices, there are dramatic differences in how blog
bodyText ||| readers understand the visible object of their activity. When
bodyText ||| asked about motivations for reading blogs, participants said
bodyText ||| they visit blogs for information, inspiration, entertainment,
bodyText ||| and to a certain extent because it is just what they have
bodyText ||| always done. However, when asked the deceptively simple
bodyText ||| question, âwhat is a blog?â the responses were far more
bodyText ||| vague and varied. Patricia responded canonically, âwell
bodyText ||| thereâs the technical term and my own definition.â How
bodyText ||| does she determine which definition to use at what time?
subsectionHeader ||| âIt Dependsâ
bodyText ||| Among our respondents, the manner of reading and
bodyText ||| interacting with a blog depends on myriad factors
bodyText ||| including, among others, the content of the blog, the intent
bodyText ||| of the reader, the perceived intent of the blogger, and the
bodyText ||| relationship of the reader to the blogger. We argue that part
bodyText ||| of the reason for the great diversity in approaches to blog
bodyText ||| reading is the great diversity of blogs. Previous work, e.g.,
bodyText ||| [11,21], has tried to classify blogs as a genre with certain
bodyText ||| structural and content-based divisions into sub-genres.
bodyText ||| However, our findings align more closely with boydâs
bodyText ||| argument [2] that blogs are a medium, and that a variety of
bodyText ||| different activities and interactions can occur in and through
bodyText ||| that medium. Furthermore, drawing on reader-response
bodyText ||| theory [17], we argue that, in order to distinguish between
bodyText ||| different types of blogs, it may be less useful to look at the
bodyText ||| structure or content of the blog and more informative to
bodyText ||| follow the ways that readers read and interact with the blog.
bodyText ||| The analysis presented here focuses on the following
bodyText ||| themes as dimensions along which approaches to blog
bodyText ||| reading may vary: the concept of a blog, perception and
bodyText ||| presentation of blogs, and âbeing a partâ of blogs. From an
bodyText ||| analytic standpoint, uncovering data based on a consistent
bodyText ||| definition of blogs seems to make intuitive sense, but given
bodyText ||| the fluid character of blogs it may be misleading to do so.
bodyText ||| Rather than trying to impose a definition of what counts or
bodyText ||| does not count as a blog, the authors strove for a more
bodyText ||| authentic, emic perspective by allowing our blog reader
bodyText ||| participants to decide what constitutes a blog. The styles of
bodyText ||| blogs that our participants read varied as much as the
bodyText ||| specific reading practices. These practices depend in large
bodyText ||| part on the readerâs approach towards, and perception of, a
bodyText ||| blog, which shape and reshape the activity of blogging
bodyText ||| itself. An example of this iterative process is Krishâs
bodyText ||| approach toward blogs; he generally views blogs as just
bodyText ||| another thing to do on the Internet when heâs bored. He
bodyText ||| calls himself a passive reader of blogs, unlikely to search
bodyText ||| out a new set of blogs despite his disappointment in the lack
bodyText ||| of content in the blogs he reads. However, during his blog
bodyText ||| reading activity Krish began to note points of interest in his
bodyText ||| hometown that were described in a blog. Now, when Krish
bodyText ||| returns home, he applies the knowledge he acquired online
bodyText ||| to his experience offline. Although Krishâs initial
bodyText ||| motivation for reading blogs shaped his self-labeled
bodyText ||| âpassive readingâ of blogs, his Internet-only experience
bodyText ||| reshaped itself into an activity with offline implications.
bodyText ||| Reader-response theory directs us to note the ways that
bodyText ||| individual readers read different blogs differently. While a
bodyText ||| blog reader may feel fine lurking on popular blogs, she or
bodyText ||| he may feel obligated to interact on the blogs of friends.
bodyText ||| Although examining format and content in order to
bodyText ||| categorize a blog may reveal a general understanding of a
bodyText ||| blog, this approach is likely to neglect the audience for
bodyText ||| whom the blog is, at least in part, intended.
subsectionHeader ||| What is a Blog?
bodyText ||| Definitions of the term âblogâ cited in the academic
bodyText ||| literature often resemble Herring et al.âs, âfrequently
bodyText ||| modified web pages in which dated entries are listed in
bodyText ||| reverse chronological orderâ [10:1]. boyd [2] provides a
bodyText ||| survey of various definitions from dictionaries, researchers,
bodyText ||| mass media, and bloggers themselves. When we asked our
bodyText ||| participants, âwhat is a blog?â the responses were a mixture
bodyText ||| that pointed to updates, commenting capabilities,
bodyText ||| authorship, RSS feeds, personal content, etc. Unlike the
bodyText ||| bloggers boyd describes, there is little or no uniformity of
bodyText ||| definition among readers. For example Judith considered
bodyText ||| the notes on facebook.com and the blog option on
bodyText ||| myspace.com examples of blogs while many others did not
bodyText ||| agree. When asked to define a blog some participants did
bodyText ||| refer to the frequency of modifications, but there was no
bodyText ||| mention of dated entries or reverse chronological order.
bodyText ||| Rather than structural features, thirteen participants
bodyText ||| discussed interactional attributes. For many bloggers, a blog
bodyText ||| is not something you have, blogging is something you do
bodyText ||| [2]. However, among our participants, there was not such a
bodyText ||| clear distinction. For example, Patricia emphasizes the
bodyText ||| conversational nature of blogging:
construct ||| A blog is something thatâs still going on, that still has a
construct ||| conversation going on, that has people commenting, [it]
page ||| 1115
note ||| CHI 2008 Proceedings Â· Shared Authoring	April 5-10, 2008 Â· Florence, Italy
construct ||| doesnât have to be all the time, but it does have this dialogue
construct ||| between the person whoâs posting and the people who are
construct ||| reading, yeah thatâs a blog.... [When the conversation stops],
construct ||| by my definition, yeah itâs a dead site.
bodyText ||| However, not all participants stressed conversational
bodyText ||| interaction. Providing another perspective, Natalie suggests
bodyText ||| that âa blog is a journal, like an electronic journal where
bodyText ||| people can express whatever they want, you know, and let
bodyText ||| everyone read it I guess.... it could be anything I guess.â
bodyText ||| Many respondents referred to âgettingâ a Xanga or
bodyText ||| âhavingâ a blog, which foregrounds the blog as a
bodyText ||| possession and backgrounds the interactivity and process of
bodyText ||| blogging. Eight participants varied in their usage of the
bodyText ||| term âblogâ: sometimes it would refer to an individual blog,
bodyText ||| an individual post, e.g., âI write a lot of blogs,â or even an
bodyText ||| entire blog-hosting site, such as when participants include
bodyText ||| LiveJournal in the blogs they frequently read.
bodyText ||| In Patriciaâs definition, the interaction that occurs makes it
bodyText ||| a blog, while in Natalieâs definition the content makes it a
bodyText ||| blog. âIt could be anythingâ demonstrates just how fluid the
bodyText ||| notion of blog can be. Another respondent, Tony, listed a
bodyText ||| series of technical requirements, including commenting and
bodyText ||| RSS, when asked if a particular website was a blog or not:
construct ||| That website is [a blog], yeah, but it doesnât have live
construct ||| comments from people who read it. It has message boards that
construct ||| are associated with it, but theyâre not as directly linked with
construct ||| different page articles, I donât know. Itâs not a static page, I
construct ||| mean every week you go to it, it will have different articles,
construct ||| but itâs not exactly the same format as a blog, it does have an
construct ||| RSS feed though so you can see whatâs new on it.
bodyText ||| If readers and writers are both involved in the co-
bodyText ||| construction of the blog [21], how do differences in
bodyText ||| definitions impact this process?
bodyText ||| As with boydâs [2] respondents, many readers used
bodyText ||| metaphors to define the term blog, and the metaphors with
bodyText ||| which they attempt to make sense of blogs in turn affect
bodyText ||| their understanding of, perception of, and interaction with
bodyText ||| blogs. Seven of the fifteen participants referred to blogs as a
bodyText ||| newspaper or magazine, and ten of the fifteen used the term
bodyText ||| diary or journal to describe at least one blog they read.
bodyText ||| These data point to the problematic nature of basing
bodyText ||| research on blogging activity upon the traditional format-
bodyText ||| oriented definition of blogs. Although a blogâs format may
bodyText ||| invite a certain reading, reader-response theory helps us
bodyText ||| understand the actual interaction or lack of interaction that
bodyText ||| occurs between the blog reader and the blogger. Although
bodyText ||| definitions found in the research literature [11,21] can be
bodyText ||| useful from an analytic standpoint, they may be less useful
bodyText ||| or even misleading when trying to understand how the
bodyText ||| bloggers and readers themselves approach blogging. When
bodyText ||| seeking to understand blogging from the bloggerâs or the
bodyText ||| readerâs perspective, the authors found it more useful and
bodyText ||| informative to consider blogs not in terms of academic
bodyText ||| definitions, but rather in the terms of those involved in the
bodyText ||| activity of blogging.
subsectionHeader ||| Presentation and Perception
bodyText ||| Previous work [1,2,15,23] has explored how bloggers use
bodyText ||| blogs as a means of presentation of self (see [9]) online.
bodyText ||| This section explores the other half of that phenomenon,
bodyText ||| that is, how readers perceive the self that bloggers present.
bodyText ||| In some respects, these results align with previous findings.
bodyText ||| However, findings about our respondents also differ in a
bodyText ||| number of important ways from previous assertions about
bodyText ||| audience and perception in blogging.
subsubsectionHeader ||| Agreement with Previous Findings
bodyText ||| Past work on authenticity, one aspect of bloggersâ
bodyText ||| presentation of self, illustrates that audiences of blogs hope
bodyText ||| and expect authenticity, and that without it readership will
bodyText ||| be lost (McNeil in [15]). For blogs, authenticity does not
bodyText ||| hinge upon the accuracy of information they present, but
bodyText ||| rather upon their interpretability. (Langellier and Peterson
bodyText ||| in [15]). Lenhart bases her conclusion on Langellier and
bodyText ||| Petersonâs examination of the persistent interpretability of
bodyText ||| narratives. Arguing that blogs are a form of narrative, she
bodyText ||| posits that the blog is perceived âas one personâs âtakeâ on
bodyText ||| an issue, one personâs perspective on a story, left open to
bodyText ||| the interpretation of, and evaluation by, the reader, rather
bodyText ||| than as an unbiased source of informationâ [15:58-59].
bodyText ||| Among our participants, eleven described the blogs they
bodyText ||| read regularly as feeling authentic. Connie âdefinitely [gets]
bodyText ||| an inside look at their livesâ, while Natalie feels like she is
bodyText ||| traveling alongside the bloggers who write about their
bodyText ||| travels. All thirteen of our participants who read single-
bodyText ||| authored blogs recognize that posts of the blogs they read
bodyText ||| regularly were either opinion or personal narratives, which
bodyText ||| are important components of the perception of authenticity.
bodyText ||| Blogs are generally considered a one-to-many medium, but
bodyText ||| are often experienced by bloggers as one-to-one [15]. In
bodyText ||| this study, eight participants have experienced blogs as one-
bodyText ||| to-one communication between them and the blogger.
bodyText ||| Selena says, âfor like some people..., I guess sometimes I
bodyText ||| feel like theyâre writing to me.â
bodyText ||| This study also shows that negotiations between online and
bodyText ||| offline identity for blog readers are similar to those of
bodyText ||| bloggers. Early research into online identity, e.g., [26],
bodyText ||| argued that people used online worlds to create alternate
bodyText ||| identities or to explore certain facets of their personality
bodyText ||| that were not as prominent. However, more recent work,
bodyText ||| e.g., [1,20], has pointed to the ways in which a personâs
bodyText ||| online identity is a part or an extension of their offline
bodyText ||| identity, such as the way that Trinidadians use the Internet
bodyText ||| as just another way of being âTriniâ [20], and that
bodyText ||| attempting to sever the two can be misleading and
bodyText ||| confusing. Similarly, while blogs and âreal lifeâ
bodyText ||| experiences are still distinct realms for readers, there is a
bodyText ||| relatively tight coupling between readersâ online and offline
bodyText ||| identities. Describing one of her friends, Fern says that âthe
bodyText ||| way he types is the way he talks and thinks,â and Lillian
bodyText ||| hesitates to refer to only her offline friends as her ârealâ
bodyText ||| friends. Were there a connection with Patriciaâs online and
bodyText ||| offline life, she says, âI [would be] a little bit surprised and
page ||| 1116
note ||| CHI 2008 Proceedings Â· Shared Authoring	April 5-10, 2008 Â· Florence, Italy
bodyText ||| a little bit happy that there was this link between my online
bodyText ||| life that I publish online with just a typical school day that it
bodyText ||| could be considered that Iâm still the same... my screen
bodyText ||| name versus me.â However, she is also wary of creating too
bodyText ||| strong a link between her online and offline identities. âI
bodyText ||| donât want my dad to find me because there was this whole
bodyText ||| breakup thing [between my mom and dad] and he wasnât
bodyText ||| such a good person.â While Lillian was initially cautious
bodyText ||| about linking her knit-blogging with her life as a graduate
bodyText ||| student, and she still does not give out her full name online,
bodyText ||| she also feels that her blogging activities are âa part of [her]
bodyText ||| and itâs not worth hiding it.â This sort of ambivalence was
bodyText ||| common among participants; they do not view the set of
bodyText ||| identities they construct through blog reading as identical to
bodyText ||| their set of offline identities, but they also do not view the
bodyText ||| two sets as totally disjoint; most of them continuously
bodyText ||| negotiate and redefine the relationship between the two.
subsubsectionHeader ||| Differences from Previous Findings
bodyText ||| Previous work on blogs has overlooked several elements of
bodyText ||| presentation and perception, possibly due to its focus on
bodyText ||| bloggers as both producers and consumers of blogs. Blog
bodyText ||| readers are often perceived by bloggers as an unnerving and
bodyText ||| anonymous group of lurkers or instigators [15], placing
bodyText ||| expectations on the blogger, creating awkward social
bodyText ||| situations, or sometimes presenting an unwanted, invading
bodyText ||| presence [2]. However, blog readers often approach
bodyText ||| different blogs differently, and may contribute differently in
bodyText ||| different contexts. Each participant shared that she or he
bodyText ||| would variously comment, lurk, or instigate, depending on
bodyText ||| the blog. As for commenting, eleven respondents stated that
bodyText ||| they would semi-regularly encounter statements or
bodyText ||| sentiments with which they disagreed, but only four
bodyText ||| participants shared instances where their views differed
bodyText ||| significantly and decided to express their disagreement
bodyText ||| through comments. However, only one of these four would
bodyText ||| make comments with the aim of instigating an awkward
bodyText ||| situation or invading the bloggerâs space. Lillian is of the
bodyText ||| opinion that âitâs not worth being negative.â She strives to
bodyText ||| ensure that âwhatever comes out of [her] mouth... or what
bodyText ||| comes out of [her] fingers is positive.â Kirsh, though, said
bodyText ||| that he enjoys bashing on bloggers or simply kindling
bodyText ||| âflame warsâ of nearly unfounded, ruthless arguments.
bodyText ||| While previous research has described the expectations
bodyText ||| readers place on bloggers, readers feel that there are certain
bodyText ||| expectations of them, as well. According to Patricia, âa
bodyText ||| good post deserves a reply from the audience,â and Jill sees
bodyText ||| â[commenting] as a courtesy.â Furthermore, while some
bodyText ||| comments are used as simple, lo-fi communication or
bodyText ||| notification mechanisms (discussed further below), many
bodyText ||| readers spend a significant amount of time formulating their
bodyText ||| comments in order for them to be coherent and insightful.
bodyText ||| In the rare event that Charles comments, he needs âtime to
bodyText ||| sit down and plot out a cogent response.â While bloggers
bodyText ||| feel pressures about the content and identity they present,
bodyText ||| readers feel pressures about ensuring that their comments
bodyText ||| make a significant contribution. Similarly, while bloggers
bodyText ||| may feel pressured to update, ten of our participants felt
bodyText ||| obligated to read or comment, particularly on friendsâ blogs
bodyText ||| or blogs of which they felt that they were âa partâ (see next
bodyText ||| section). Selena âadmitsâ that there are some posts, even on
bodyText ||| blogs of close friends, that she does not read. Lillian was
bodyText ||| relieved to learn that other readers did not follow every
bodyText ||| single post and skimmed many. However, while a reader
bodyText ||| can âget awayâ with not reading every post without much
bodyText ||| notice, it is more obvious when there are lapses on the part
bodyText ||| of the blogger. Though expectations and obligations may
bodyText ||| not be symmetrical, the activity of blogging nevertheless
bodyText ||| exerts social pressures on both bloggers and readers.
bodyText ||| However, the situation with respect to readersâ expectations
bodyText ||| is somewhat more complex still. Thirteen respondents
bodyText ||| expressed expectations with regard to update frequency,
bodyText ||| visual style, navigability, responsiveness, appropriateness,
bodyText ||| and other aspects. However, just as readers read different
bodyText ||| blogs differently, they have different expectations of
bodyText ||| different blogs. Expectations are often more lax for friendsâ
bodyText ||| blogs and greater for more popular âbigâ blogs. On the
bodyText ||| other hand, for example, when readers comment on these
bodyText ||| big blogs, they rarely expect a response, while a comment
bodyText ||| on a friendâs blog almost demands reciprocation. Natalie is
bodyText ||| interested in travel, and so often reads and comments on
bodyText ||| travel blogs. She does not expect the blogger to respond to
bodyText ||| her questions, but is pleasantly surprised when it happens.
bodyText ||| Differences in expectations of blogger and reader are not
bodyText ||| split only along the lines of friend blogs vs. big blogs. For
bodyText ||| example, on knit blogs, Lillian comments, answers
bodyText ||| questions, and provides positive feedback, but she is
bodyText ||| unwilling to do the same on other blogs she reads, such as a
bodyText ||| science blog that relates to her graduate studies.
bodyText ||| Many of these differencesâin expectations, in
bodyText ||| commenting, in other regardsâcan be traced to the readerâs
bodyText ||| perception of the blogger or blog, and to the readerâs
bodyText ||| motivation for reading. Lillian views the knit and craft
bodyText ||| blogs as a community and often attributes certain
bodyText ||| characteristics of the community to its primarily female
bodyText ||| composition. Tony accounts for his commenting practices
bodyText ||| as something he enjoys doing as an engineer. Charles reads
bodyText ||| blogs as a routine that helps him obtain information. Judith
bodyText ||| reads primarily to keep in contact with friends. It is not only
bodyText ||| the way the blogger presents herself or himself that affects
bodyText ||| the readers perception of the blogger, but also the purpose
bodyText ||| for which the reader is reading.
bodyText ||| Although this paper focuses on blog readers, only three of
bodyText ||| the fifteen participants do not have their own blog. Despite
bodyText ||| the fact that many of our participants are also bloggers, at
bodyText ||| least nominally, the findings presented here are still
bodyText ||| applicable to blog readers, because, as argued above, there
bodyText ||| is no evidence in the literature that there exist bloggers who
bodyText ||| do not read blogs. However, one difference is the tendency
bodyText ||| for the non-bloggers to read only popular, highly trafficked
bodyText ||| blogs, whereas, of the twelve blog readers with blogs, ten
bodyText ||| used their blogs to keep up with friends. Ultimately, though,
page ||| 1117
note ||| CHI 2008 Proceedings Â· Shared Authoring	April 5-10, 2008 Â· Florence, Italy
bodyText ||| the activity of blog reading is neither a dichotomy of
bodyText ||| blogger versus reader nor a set of transactions that are
bodyText ||| confined to the materiality of the blog. âIt dependsâ
bodyText ||| describes how the experience of blog reading is highly
bodyText ||| contingent on the individual reader and not solely the blog.
subsectionHeader ||| âBeing a Partâ
bodyText ||| When discussions with respondents turned to themes of
bodyText ||| participation in, and contribution to, the blogs they read,
bodyText ||| eleven of them described feeling that they were a âpartâ of
bodyText ||| a blog in some way. This is distinct from the feeling of
bodyText ||| membership or belonging in a community [6,12]. Some
bodyText ||| respondents felt that they were part of a blog without ever
bodyText ||| making their individual presence known to the blogger or
bodyText ||| other readers. Being part of a blog is more than consistent
bodyText ||| readership, a sense of community, or a feeling of
bodyText ||| connectedness, although it includes all those things.
bodyText ||| Readership is one component to being a part of a blog.
bodyText ||| Connie stated that, âjust by reading I feel like Iâm
bodyText ||| participating.â Nevertheless, a few question if they are part
bodyText ||| of any of the blogs that they read. For Charles, the idea of a
bodyText ||| community is a central component to the definition of a
bodyText ||| blog, and thus he does not feel part of a blog because he
bodyText ||| does not consistently contribute as he might expect a
bodyText ||| community-member to do. Importantly, Charles reads
bodyText ||| mostly âbigâ blogsâones that are relatively popular,
bodyText ||| generate a high volume of traffic, and receive copious
bodyText ||| commentsâand while other participants could be a part of
bodyText ||| a big blog without commenting, some sort of interaction
bodyText ||| was necessary for Charles. While an important component
bodyText ||| of being a part, readership alone is often not sufficient.
bodyText ||| Six of the fifteen participants said specifically that they felt
bodyText ||| âconnectedâ to a blog or blogger. Kuwabara et al.âs
bodyText ||| examination of FaintPop [14] revealed that the ability to
bodyText ||| express things that might not be considered an important
bodyText ||| topic of conversation, such as moods, help construct a
bodyText ||| feeling of connectedness. In the blogosphere, such
bodyText ||| examples are lo-fi comments, ones that are short, do not
bodyText ||| convey much content-wise, and are relatively generic.
bodyText ||| These comments also share certain aspects with the
bodyText ||| communication afforded by the Virtual Intimate Object
bodyText ||| (VIO) [13], in that they are relatively low bandwidth
bodyText ||| communication but carry a high degree of meaning and
bodyText ||| value for both reader and blogger. However, of the
bodyText ||| participants who expressed a feeling of connectedness, only
bodyText ||| Natalie described a feeling of presence similar to FaintPop
bodyText ||| or the VIO. When reading travel blogs she feels as if she is
bodyText ||| traveling with the blogger, sharing the bloggerâs
bodyText ||| experiences, supporting her or his travels. Furthermore,
bodyText ||| though lo-fi comments are not the exception, they are not
bodyText ||| the rule, either. Although Cheryl feels connected to one of
bodyText ||| the sports-fan blogs she reads, she has yet to feel the need
bodyText ||| to leave comments of any sort. On the one hand, there is an
bodyText ||| argument that the readers who do not comment are not
bodyText ||| really connected, or that those who comment are more
bodyText ||| connected. Drawing on reader response theory, this paper
bodyText ||| argues instead that connectedness is constituted differently
bodyText ||| in different contexts; being a part of a blog looks different
bodyText ||| for different readers, and connectedness, even when
bodyText ||| achieved by different means, is still connectedness.
bodyText ||| Connectedness does not always entail feeling connected to
bodyText ||| the blogger as a person. Despite the distinctive personal
bodyText ||| style and presentation of self in many blogs, not all readers
bodyText ||| visit blogs for the blogger. Instead, they are more interested
bodyText ||| in the content or information presented on the blog. Among
bodyText ||| our respondents, ten of fifteen read certain blogs because
bodyText ||| they know or are familiar with the blogger in person, while
bodyText ||| eleven of fifteen read certain blogs because they want
bodyText ||| information about a particular topic. However, motivations
bodyText ||| can change over time. During the interviews, eleven
bodyText ||| participants described situations where they began reading
bodyText ||| blogs for information purposes, but continued reading
bodyText ||| because they developed a connection with the blogger.
bodyText ||| Cheryl reads fourfour, a blog with pop culture news and
bodyText ||| commentary. Initially, she started reading for the bloggerâs
bodyText ||| witty and insightful entries about hip hop and âsnarky
bodyText ||| commentaryâ about reality TV shows. However, the
bodyText ||| blogger would also occasionally post about his cats.
construct ||| At first, when he was posting pictures about his cat, not that I
construct ||| thought it was a little nutty, but it was like, âwhatâs the sense
construct ||| in doing this?â, but then I would read the entries and they
construct ||| would be really cute or hilarious pictures so then I became
construct ||| even a fan of the cat postings then I was like, âoh my god, this
construct ||| is so pettyâ.... heâs a charismatic person so pretty much any
construct ||| topic youâll get some sort of satisfaction or chuckle...
bodyText ||| Even though Cheryl was initially drawn to the blog for the
bodyText ||| content, she ended up feeling connected with the blogger
bodyText ||| due in part to the personal information with which he
bodyText ||| supplemented his posts. In contrast, there were no instances
bodyText ||| where a blog reader began reading a blog for the blogger,
bodyText ||| and despite a falling out or loss of feeling connected
bodyText ||| continued to read for the content. This pattern suggests that,
bodyText ||| contrary to previous findings [2,23], it is important not to
bodyText ||| conflate the blogger with the content of the blog when
bodyText ||| considering the perspective of the reader.
sectionHeader ||| SUMMARY AND IMPLICATIONS
bodyText ||| This section highlights salient themes from the above
bodyText ||| findings as well as potential implications. These include not
bodyText ||| only design implications, but also more broadly future
bodyText ||| research directions and societal implications.
bodyText ||| Routine â All of our participants mentioned in some way
bodyText ||| the habitual nature of blog reading. Charlesâ statement that
bodyText ||| reading blogs is âsomething that happensâ frames the reader
bodyText ||| as passive, neither self-aware nor reflective about their
bodyText ||| reading. While some participants were conscious of why
bodyText ||| they read blogs, few were reflective of how they read. For
bodyText ||| example, participants rarely reflected on the routine or
bodyText ||| time-consuming nature of blog reading prior to
bodyText ||| participation in this study. This finding suggests that
bodyText ||| designing tools to raise self-awareness and encourage
bodyText ||| reflection could be valuable in transforming routinized blog
page ||| 1118
note ||| CHI 2008 Proceedings Â· Shared Authoring	April 5-10, 2008 Â· Florence, Italy
bodyText ||| reading into a more engaging, fulfilling experience. Future
bodyText ||| work should also compare blog reading to other routine
bodyText ||| media use, such as watching television, checking email,
bodyText ||| reading the newspaper, or listening to the radio.
bodyText ||| Not Information Overload â Research on information
bodyText ||| retrieval (IR) and related areas often asserts that the copious
bodyText ||| quantity of information available leads to information
bodyText ||| overload, wherein overwhelmed users are unable to find
bodyText ||| relevant or important information in the ever-growing
bodyText ||| deluge. However, among this studyâs participants, only two
bodyText ||| feel overwhelmed by the information content available to
bodyText ||| them. These readers do not feel the need to be constantly up
bodyText ||| to date with everything posted in the blogs they read. More
bodyText ||| studies should explore information overload, or lack
bodyText ||| thereof, from usersâ perspectives in other contexts, so as not
bodyText ||| to spend research time developing IR algorithms that
bodyText ||| alleviate a problem not actually experienced by users.
bodyText ||| Non-chronous â While readers experience blog posts in
bodyText ||| temporal order, the exact times of the posts does not
bodyText ||| significantly impact the reading activity. The recency of a
bodyText ||| post has more to do with the number of other posts that
bodyText ||| have occurred since the post in question than with the
bodyText ||| amount of time that has passed. Not only does this finding
bodyText ||| have implications for the design of blog reading tools with
bodyText ||| respect to determining what content users/readers will find
bodyText ||| important, but it also points to the ways in which
bodyText ||| technologies such as blogs influence perceptions of
bodyText ||| temporality. The passage of time here is marked by the
bodyText ||| occurrence of certain events, i.e., posts, such that the
bodyText ||| significance of a period of time and even the perception of
bodyText ||| how much time has elapsed are influenced by how much
bodyText ||| happens in that period, i.e., how many posts occur. Future
bodyText ||| studies should pay attention to the ways in which the design
bodyText ||| and use of other technologies and communication media,
bodyText ||| such as instant messaging, email, or Twitter, influence how
bodyText ||| users perceive and constitute the passage of time.
bodyText ||| Identityâ This paper builds on previous studies of online
bodyText ||| identity by exploring readersâ perceptions of bloggersâ
bodyText ||| identities. The findings here agree with previous ones, for
bodyText ||| example, that online and offline identities are not
bodyText ||| completely separate and distinct from one another [2,20],
bodyText ||| but there are also differences. For example, while previous
bodyText ||| work has looked at the obligations the blogger feels from
bodyText ||| his or her audience, this paper looked also at the obligations
bodyText ||| readers feel toward the blogger. Also, these findings
bodyText ||| indicate disconnects between the pressures felt by bloggers
bodyText ||| and the expectations of readers. While these findings
bodyText ||| provide future directions for exploring identity perception
bodyText ||| and presentation in social media and its connection to other
bodyText ||| aspects of interaction, such as privacy, appropriateness, and
bodyText ||| authority, they also suggest a design space for tools to allow
bodyText ||| more nuanced interactions between bloggers and readers.
bodyText ||| âBeing a Partâ â Being a part of a blog involves regular
bodyText ||| reading, a feeling of community, and a sense of
bodyText ||| connectedness, though these aspects are neither necessary
bodyText ||| nor sufficient. What it takes to be a part of a blog varies
bodyText ||| depending on the individual reader and the specific blog,
bodyText ||| especially whether it is a âbigâ popular blog or a personal
bodyText ||| friendâs blog. Based on these varied interactions between
bodyText ||| reader and blog, readership is defined and constituted
bodyText ||| differently in different contexts. Future work should
bodyText ||| examine the feeling of âbeing a partâ both in different
bodyText ||| social media, such as YouTube or Wikipedia, as well as in
bodyText ||| instances where the division between authors and readers is
bodyText ||| more nebulous or even nonexistent, such as social
bodyText ||| networking sites or Twitter. Furthermore, it will be
bodyText ||| important to examine how participation in these and other
bodyText ||| online interactions impacts our definition of what it means
bodyText ||| to be a member of a community, both online and offline.
bodyText ||| Interactional Approach â drawing on reader response
bodyText ||| theory [3,17] and recent trends in HCI research [5], the
bodyText ||| research presented here takes an interactional approach to
bodyText ||| studying blog reading, shifting the focus from structural,
bodyText ||| technical, or content-oriented aspects of blogs to the
bodyText ||| readerâs experiences with them. This approach leads to
bodyText ||| novel, reader-centered definitions of the term âblogâ based
bodyText ||| on the types of reading and interaction it allows and
bodyText ||| encourages. Focusing on interaction also foregrounds the
bodyText ||| ways in which blogs are not a genre but a medium for
bodyText ||| multi-directional communication among bloggers and
bodyText ||| readers. Previous work focused predominantly on the
bodyText ||| blogger, and this paper focuses mostly on readers. Future
bodyText ||| work should take an integrative approach, looking at the
bodyText ||| same interaction from both the bloggerâs and the readerâs
bodyText ||| perspectives, as well as looking at interactions between
bodyText ||| blog readers in specific contexts, such as political blogs,
bodyText ||| religious blogs, or mommy blogs. What interactional
bodyText ||| aspects of blogging, including both blogger and reader, are
bodyText ||| unique to each of these communities? What aspects
bodyText ||| transcend individual communities to characterize blogging
bodyText ||| in general? How do common practices from blogging
bodyText ||| impact social interaction in other contexts beyond blogs?
sectionHeader ||| CONCLUSION
bodyText ||| In examining the increasingly common social activity of
bodyText ||| blogging, we must consider the experiences, roles, and
bodyText ||| contributions of readers, even when less readily apparent
bodyText ||| than those of bloggers. This paper presents a qualitative
bodyText ||| study that focuses on blog readers, their reading practices,
bodyText ||| their perceptions of blogs and bloggers, and what it means
bodyText ||| to be a part of a blog. The findings presented here indicate
bodyText ||| that the activity of blogging, of which readers are an
bodyText ||| integral part, is far more heterogeneous and multifaceted
bodyText ||| than previously suggested. Even though ten of our fifteen
bodyText ||| participants are between 18-25 years old and eleven of
bodyText ||| fifteen are students, the ways in which they read blogs, and
bodyText ||| even their definitions of what constitutes a blog, are
bodyText ||| dramatically different. The analysis here draws on reader-
bodyText ||| response theory to argue that, rather than using structural or
bodyText ||| content-based features in order to classify blogs, it may be
bodyText ||| more informative to consider them in terms of interactional
bodyText ||| features and readersâ experiences. This focus resonates with

note ||| CHI 2008 Proceedings Â· Shared Authoring	April 5-10, 2008 Â· Florence, Italy
bodyText ||| current trends in HCI, such as embodied interaction [5].
bodyText ||| This paper describes various ways in which blog reading is
bodyText ||| more than just reading. It leads the reader to form complex
bodyText ||| definitions of the term âblog,â each of which differs to
bodyText ||| varying degrees from the definitions used by bloggers. The
bodyText ||| paper also offers a view into the perception of the digital
bodyText ||| presentation of self in blogs. Blog reading allows for widely
bodyText ||| varied means of âbeing a part,â giving rise to new notions
bodyText ||| of community and belonging. This paper outlines the role of
bodyText ||| the reader in the activity of blogging, laying a general
bodyText ||| foundation for future work.
