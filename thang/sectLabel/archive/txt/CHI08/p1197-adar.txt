ABSTRACT
Our work examines Web revisitation patterns. Everybody 
revisits Web pages, but their reasons for doing so can differ 
depending on the particular Web page, their topic of 
interest, and their intent. To characterize how people revisit 
Web content, we analyzed five weeks of Web interaction 
logs of over 612,000 users. We supplemented these 
findings by a survey intended to identify the intent behind 
the observed revisitation. Our analysis reveals four primary 
revisitation patterns, each with unique behavioral, content, 
and structural characteristics. Through our analysis we 
illustrate how understanding revisitation patterns can enable 
Web sites to provide improved navigation, Web browsers to 
predict users’ destinations, and search engines to better 
support fast, fresh, and effective finding and re-finding.

INTRODUCTION
Revisiting Web pages is common, but an individual’s 
reasons for returning to different pages can be diverse. For 
example, a person may revisit a shopping site’s homepage 
every couple of weeks to check for sales. That same person 
may also revisit the site’s listing of fantasy books many 
times in just a few minutes while trying to find a new book.
To better understand Web page revisitation, we analyzed 
the interaction logs of a large number of opt-in users over a 
period of five weeks. The logs contained a history of all of 
the Web page visits made by more than 612,000 users. 
Thanks to the large quantity of data, it was possible for us 
to explore the revisitation patterns for specific Web pages 
along a number of dimensions not previously feasible. We 
observed that even very similar pages can have very

different revisitation patterns. Our analysis suggests such 
differences can be due to a number of factors, including a 
person’s intent, page content, and site structure.
The log data enables us to characterize the differences 
between revisitation patterns, but it is difficult to deduce 
revisitation intent without a more detailed survey or 
observational data. For example, someone may revisit a 
Web page frequently during a short interval of time because 
they are monitoring changing content contained in the page, 
or they may do so because they are using the site as a hub to 
navigate to linked pages. For this reason, we supplemented 
the log data with a survey in which we asked participants to 
describe their reasons for revisiting specific pages.
By combining revisitation patterns and survey data, we find 
four main patterns of revisitation that are characterized by 
various factors including usage, content, structure, and 
intent. This analysis can enable Web sites, Web browsers, 
and search engines to better support revisitation, and we 
discuss the design implications of our findings.
RELATED WORK
Early research aimed at understanding general Web 
navigation and surfing behavior first reported a large 
amount of re-access of information (e.g., [4]). To better 
understand and quantify this phenomenon, subsequent 
studies were designed to specifically address revisitation 
behavior. These studies come primarily in two main flavors 
(though some, like our own, mix elements):
•	Log studies, where browsing patterns are monitored 
either through proxies or instrumented browsers ([6, 9, 
14, 17, 23]).
•	Survey/interview studies, in which a questionnaire or
interview is constructed to understand specific 
behaviors ([1, 13, 21]).
Studies of revisitation have demonstrated that 50% [9, 23] 
to 80% [6] of all Web surfing behavior involves pages that 
users have previously visited. While many revisitations 
occur shortly after a page’s first visit (e.g., during the same 
session using the back button), a significant number occur 
after a considerable amount of time has elapsed [17].
Two significant outcomes of earlier efforts have been the 
creation of taxonomies of browsing behavior in relationship 
to revisitation [14] and suggestions for improving the 
design of Web browsers [1, 17], search engines [1, 25, 26], 
and personal information management systems [10].

Taxonomies in this space have sought to define revisitation 
in terms of user intent, goals, or strategies [16]. New 
browser designs have concentrated on better back buttons 
[8, 15], history or bookmarks [2, 11, 22], and monitoring 
and notification features [13]. Furthermore, several 
products and browser plug-ins have emerged to assist users 
in revisitation and monitoring activities (e.g. [5]).
The work we present here distinguishes itself from previous 
studies in a number of significant ways. First, to our 
knowledge, this is by far the largest study of Web 
revisitation behavior. While other studies have observed at 
most a few hundred participants in their population, the 
cohort in our work exceeds 612,000 people. Second, while 
other studies have pursued the longitudinal tracking of a 
small number of individuals in their complete, unbounded, 
interactions with the Web, we attempt to capture the 
interaction of hundreds of thousands of people with a 
specific set of Web pages. By broadly sampling pages and 
people we can begin to understand the characteristics of a 
page that are associated with specific revisitation behaviors.
A novel aspect of our methodology is that we are able to 
find diverse Web pages that are (re-)accessed in many 
different ways. With a small user population it is difficult 
to find Web pages that are not considered “popular” but are 
nonetheless visited sufficiently for statistical analysis. 
That is, the likelihood of two people in a small population 
both visiting anything but very popular pages is low. With 
the large user population in our study we are able to find 
multiple access patterns for all but the most unpopular 
pages. By understanding the variety of revisitation patterns 
we can provide design insights to better support the range 
of observed behaviors.
METHODOLOGY
To understand how and why a person revisits a Web page, 
we analyzed data from a variety of sources. The three main 
sources, usage information, self-reported intent, and Web 
page content, are summarized in Table 1. Below, we 
discuss how each type of information was collected.
Usage Information
We collected Web page visitation information by analyzing 
the logs collected from opt-in users of the Windows Live 
Toolbar. The toolbar provides augmented search features 
and reports anonymized usage behavior to a central server. 
Our analysis makes use of data from a sample of 612,000 
users for a five week period starting August 1, 2006. The 
five week period is sufficient to capture a wide variety of 
revisitation patterns, although we may seasonal or yearly 
patterns. However, as part of a different study of data from 
May and June of 2007, we took the opportunity to validate 
our findings and identified the same general patterns 
described below.
User Selection
Users were identified by an anonymized ID associated with 
each toolbar. As is the case with large-scale log analyses, if 
more than one person uses the same computer, they will 
have the same ID. However, we believe that, with the 
exception of some very popular URLs, revisits will be user 
specific. To simplify the discussion we refer to a toolbar 
instance as a “user.”
For simplicity, we restricted our sample to data gathered 
from English speaking users in the United States. We also 
filtered to eliminate users for which there was limited data. 
Only users for which we had data for over 7 days were 
considered. In order to eliminate the “long-tail” of non-
representative instances, users’ activities were characterized 
on a number of dimensions including: total number of 
URLs visited, unique URLs visited, number of URLs 
revisited, and number of URLs visited per day. The lowest 
ten percent of users in any of these dimensions were 
removed from the study population. Finally, users in the 
top one percent were also excluded (to eliminate robots and 
other badly behaving clients). The result of this filtering, 
for the time period of the study is over 612,000 valid users.
URL Selection
Because we were interested not only in pages with different 
popularity but pages with different revisitation patterns we 
defined a number of attributes for each page which we then 
used to systematically sample pages for further analysis. 
Specifically, we consider the number of unique visitors to a 
page (unique-visitors), the average and median inter-arrival 
(i.e. revisit) times for a page (inter-arrival time), and the 
average and median number of revisits per user for a page 
(per-user revisits). Per-user revisits for a page represents 
the median number of times a user will revisit that page.
Figure 1a shows a scatter plot of pages along these three 
dimensions, as well as histograms for each of the three 
criteria individually (log-scaled). Figure 1 c highlights that

dimensions of interest. 1b-d are the histograms for per-user visit, unique visitors, and inter-arrival time 
respectively (each point is a set of pages). The 55k pages were sampled from these distributions.
most pages were visited by very few people overall (the top 
leftmost point indicating that over one million pages only 
had one unique visitor), with a small number of revisits per 
person (Figure 1b), and at low (fast) inter-arrival times 
(Figure 1d). To sample broadly from this space without 
over-selecting from this “long-tail” we applied a pseudo- 
exponential binning to find thresholds for the unique-visitor 
(with a minimum of two) and per-user revisit criteria. The 
specific thresholds are noted as vertical lines in Figure 1(b- 
d). For the inter-arrival time criteria we opted to use 
thresholds that correspond to well understood time periods 
(e.g. 10 seconds, 1 minute, 1 hour, 1 day, 1 week).
As illustrated in Figure 1a, we defined four bins for the 
unique-visitor criteria, five for the per-user revisit criteria, 
and six for the inter-arrival time criteria (for a combination 
of 4 x 5 x 6 = 120 possible bins). Each URL was annotated 
with these three bin numbers, and we sampled from this 
space. Some oversampling of popular pages was added by 
explicitly including the top 5000 most visited pages. We 
crawled the pages to ensure that they were still publicly 
available (in conformance with the robots.txt protocol), and 
removed from further analysis those that were not. The 
final sample included 54,788 URLs with an average of 
468.3 (median 650) URLs in each of the 120 bins.
Self-Reported Intent
The interaction logs allow us to observe what people did, 
and led us to categorize revisitation in a way that 
emphasizes observable behaviors. However, the logs do 
not tell us why people behaved the way we observed. For 
this reason we conducted a complimentary user survey to 
gather information about user intent. In addition to helping 
us better understand revisitation patterns, the results of the 
user study also serve to relate our behavioral observations 
to previous taxonomies of revisitation that focus on intent 
(e.g., monitoring or communication [14]).
Twenty volunteers participated in the study (all daily 
WWW users; 7 were in their 20s, 9 in their 30s, and four 
were 40 or older; 19 were male). Participants were 
employees of Microsoft in a range of roles (developers, 
researchers, interns, program managers, etc.) Each 
participant installed software to log Web page visits, which 
they used for one to two months. We recorded visits only 
for the 55,000 URLs in our log study as well as a random 
subset from the user’s cache and Web history. At the end 
of the logging period, participants were asked to complete a 
survey to gather greater detail about ten of the Web pages 
they had revisited during the observation period. Of the 
survey responses, 49% (~80 URLs) overlapped with the 
55,000 pages in the log study. The remaining URLs

included a number of intranet pages which were used for 
additional qualitative analysis.
For each Web page in the survey, participants were asked 
whether they remembered visiting and revisiting the page. 
If they remembered the page, they were asked to indicate 
their intent when visiting from a list of options (e.g., to 
check for new information, to purchase, to communicate, 
etc.). If they recalled visiting the page more than once, they 
were further asked to describe how often they visited the 
page, and whether they visited it at regular intervals.
Web Page Content
The content of a Web page and its URL can also contain 
clues as to why the page was revisited. A custom crawler 
collected content information by downloading and indexing 
each Web page. Each page was crawled every hour for a 
month to examine the changes in page content over time. 
Although the times of the crawls do not correspond exactly 
with the revisitation observed in the logs, the crawled 
content is likely similar. We classified each Web page into 
topical categories using standard techniques [20]. The 
topical categories used are similar to those found in the first 
two levels of the Open Directory [18]. Additionally, a 
second classifier identified various generic genres including 
sites for children, mail, pornography, etc.
REVISITATION CURVES
Construction
To compare and evaluate revisitation behavior for different 
URLs we introduce the concept of a revisitation curve. A 
revisitation curve is a normalized histogram of inter-visit 
(i.e., revisit) times for all users visiting a specific Web page, 
and characterizes the page’s revisitation pattern.
Table 2 illustrates the relationship between page visits and 
revisitation curves. For each row, four page visits are 
represented as four tall bars along a time line. The 
revisitation curve is a histogram of the inter-visit times. 
The x-axis represents the inter-visit time interval, and the y- 
axis represents a count of the number of visits to the page 
separated by that interval. The specific density of visits 
determines the shape of the revisitation curve. For 
example, the page in the first row shows four visits in rapid 
succession, and none at longer intervals, so the revisitation 
curve shows a high number of revisitations in the smallest
interval bin. In contrast, visits in the second row are spread 
out which shifts the peak of the revisitation to the right 
(corresponding to a higher inter-arrival time bin). Note that 
the number of visits in each example is the same. That is, 
the same number of visits per user can result in very 
different revisitation curves.
Revisitation curves are generated first by calculating all 
inter-arrival times between consecutive pairs of revisits. 
Deltas, in minutes, are computed for all users revisiting a 
specific URL (Δminutes = floor(Δseconds / 60)). Because 
binning by minute results in very sparse data for slow 
revisits, 16 exponential bins were used to smooth the 
histograms and to provide a finer grained resolution than 
the six bins used in URL sampling. Some manual tuning of 
the bin boundaries was used to generate more descriptive 
timescales. The boundaries were 1, 5.5, 11, 32, 64 (~hour), 
98, 136, 212, 424, 848, 1696 (~day), 3392, 6784, 13568 
(~week), 27136 (~2 weeks), and 55000 minutes (~month).
Because histograms are count based, URLs that had many 
more visitors or more revisits per visitor had higher counts. 
In order to compare revisitation patterns between URLs we 
normalize each individual curve by the centroid (i.e. 
average) of all curves. This centroid is depicted in Figure 2 
(which also illustrates the effects of binning and bin 
location). This bottom curve shows the normalized 
histogram using the raw (un-binned) data. The periodicity 
in the figure corresponds to a 24 hour cycle and is likely 
due to the daily patterns of Internet usage. If a person has a 
“usual” time for Web surfing, this kind of periodic behavior 
will be seen in revisitation curves (similar to periodicities 
observed in re-finding behavior [19]). The top portion of 
the figure shows the smoother centroid curve that is 
obtained by summing over all points in each of the 16 inter- 
visit bins, which are shown as vertical lines.
To complete the normalization, for each URL the un-
normalized bins in each revisitation curve were divided by 
the corresponding count in the centroid.

pages in the 55,000 sample.

For every bin, i:
(normalized) revisit-curveurl[i] = counturl[i] / centroid[i]
Roughly speaking, the normalized revisitation curve for 
each URL represents the percentage over, or under, revisits 
to that URL compared to the average revisit pattern. 
Though there are a number of other ways to normalize this 
type of data (normalize to 0-1 range, subtract out the 
centroid, etc.) we find that our mechanism works well in 
practice and allows us to simultaneously compare and 
group the different behavior patterns in our study.
Examples of revisitation curves for two specific URLs are:
•	---&apos;\ http://www.amazon.com/ has a revisit curve that 
peaks towards the right, indicating that most revisits 
occur after a longer time period (over a day).
•	d*­������ http://www.cnn.com/ displays a peak on the left, 
perhaps driven by automatic reloads, along with a 
higher middle region, perhaps due to users checking for 
latest news.
Grouping
We consider each revisitation curve to be a signature of 
user behavior in accessing a given Web page. Given our 
representation of behavior it is natural to ask about the 
range of different curves. In order to group these curves we 
apply a clustering algorithm to the 55,000 curves to group 
those that have similar shape and magnitude. Specifically, 
we use repeated-bisection clustering [12] with a cosine 
similarity metric and the ratio of intra- to extra- cluster 
similarity as the objective function. In practice we find that 
clusters are fairly stable regardless of the specific clustering 
or similarity metric. By varying the number of clusters and 
testing within- and between-cluster similarity we find that 
the objective function levels off at around 12 clusters
(graphically represented in Table 3 and Figure 3), which we 
use in the analyses below.
As shown in Table 3, we further ordered, named, and 
manually grouped the clusters based on general trends into 
four groups: fast, medium, slow, and hybrid. Many 
revisitation patterns fell at the extremes. Five clusters 
represented primarily fast revisitation patterns, where 
people revisited the member Web pages many times over a 
short interval but rarely revisited over longer intervals. On 
the other hand, four clusters represented slow revisitation 
patterns, with people revisiting the member pages mostly at 
intervals of a week or more. Between these two extremes 
are two groups of clusters. One is a hybrid combination of 
fast and slow revisitations, and displays a bimodal 
revisitation pattern. The other type consists of two medium 
clusters comprised of URLs that are revisited primarily at 
intervals between an hour and a day. The clusters in this 
group are less peaked and show more variability in 
revisitation intervals than the fast or slow groups.
The self-reported revisitation reinforces the selection of our 
grouping criteria as patterns from the surveys were fairly 
consistent, not only with the participant’s observed page 
interactions, but with patterns in the aggregate log data. 
Participants tended to report hourly or daily visits to pages 
that were clustered as fast or medium-term revisitation, and 
weekly, monthly or longer revisits those pages with slow 
revisitation patterns. The self-reported regularity of access 
decreased as the visitation interval increased. Participants 
reported visiting early and medium pages at regular 
intervals, and slow pages at irregular intervals.
In our discussion of the clusters, we focus primarily on 
large trends between these groups of clusters. Where 
appropriate, we also discuss details of the specific clusters.

ANALYSIS OF REVISITATION PATTERNS
Using the properties described in Table 1, we characterized 
the pages that fell into each cluster group. Our findings 
were further supplemented by a manual examination of the 
Web pages closest to each cluster’s centroid. A summary 
of our findings can be found in Table 4. Unless noted 
otherwise, all results are significant as measured using 
ANOVA/Kruskal-Wallis with post hoc tests, or χ2-tests as 
appropriate. In most cases, a two-tailed significance level 
of p &lt; .0017 was used. This represents a .01 experiment- 
wise error rate using a Bonferroni correction for six 
dependent pair-wise tests. All differences in Table 4 are 
significant except for four pair-wise comparisons—the 
medium and hybrid groups do not differ in the unique 
visitors or URL length (chars); the fast and hybrid groups 
do not differ in % domain .com; and the slow and hybrid 
groups do not differ in % domain .edu. For tests involving 
terms or topics, X2-tests were used and the significance 
levels of individual tests were corrected to preserve an 
experiment-wise error rate of .01.
Fast Group ���—
Pages in the fast group tended to be revisited at intervals of 
less than an hour. Such sites elicit quick revisitation by 
forced reloads or shallow exploration and receive almost no 
long term revisitations. There are a number of reasons why 
Web pages may display a fast revisitation pattern.
Pornography &amp; Spam: A main category in fast group, and in
particular in cluster F1 ������, were spam or porn pages.
Thirty eight percent of the URLs in F1 (4746 of 12474) 
were categorized as Porn (compared to the average cluster 
which contained 923 pages of porn representing 16.5% of 
pages in that cluster). Pages in the fast group were also 
likely to contain words like “xxx”, “sex”, “photo”, and 
“free” in the URLs and the text of the pages. .
Hub &amp; Spoke: Many of the pages in the fast group appeared 
to exhibit a hub-and-spoke revisitation pattern. For 
example, a person may start at a list of all products, such as 
a table of blouses, visit an individual product description 
pages and then rapidly return to the original page to explore 
more options. As evidence of this “shopping page” 
behavior, fast pages were more likely than pages in other 
groups to contain the words, “buy”, “catalog”, or “shop” in 
the URL, and to belong to shopping-related categories. The 
two most popular categories for this group (seen in Table 4) 
are Home &amp; Garden and Clothes &amp; Accessories, both of 
which are comprised mostly of shopping pages.
We hypothesized that visits to hub-and-spoke pages would 
be particularly likely to be preceded by a visit to a page in 
the same domain, and we found that this was indeed the 
case. Seventy seven percent of all revisits in the fast group 
were from the same domain. This is significantly more 
than the percent of visits from the same domain to pages in 
the medium (43.8%) or slow (56.5%) groups. Additionally, 
the fast group had the highest number of links on the page 
pointing back at pages in the same site (87%). The longer
URLs for pages in this group is also consistent with pages 
reached by internal site navigation.
Shopping &amp; Reference Web sites: We found that not only 
specific Web pages but entire Web sites may display an 
over-representation of URLs in the fast group. These 
include a number of shopping/classifieds Web sites (e.g. 
Craigslist and Kelly’s Blue Book) as well as reference 
pages. For example, pages belonging to Wikipedia and the 
Internet Movie Database (IMDB) appeared more often in 
this group (though the homepages themselves were in the 
slow group). We may hypothesize that certain information 
needs, such as specific encyclopedia details, are localized 
temporally. User satisfying such needs may revisit 
frequently for the current information need, but do not 
generally return again for an extended period of time.
Auto refresh: Another reason for frequent fast revisits was 
that pages were auto-refreshing. For example, CNN’s 
homepage causes a browser refresh every 30 minutes, Fox 
New’s homepage every 10, Bloomberg every 5, and Sports 
Illustrated refreshes game scores every 60 seconds. In 
particular, pages in clusters F3 ���_ and F4 A�������, 
with peaks at five and ten minutes respectively, may be 
pages where much of the revisitation occurs from auto- 
refresh. Both clusters display an over-representation of the 
terms “meta refresh” and “window.location” corresponding 
to the HTML and Javascript reload mechanisms. Further 
supporting this hypothesis is the fact that the visited page 
immediately preceding pages in these clusters are exactly 
the same 29% of the time, compared with 12% of the time 
for pages in the medium group and 10% of the time for 
pages in the slow group.
Fast monitoring: From our user survey we found that 
monitoring applications in this domain tended to be for 
quickly changing information that required attention for a 
short period. For example, a page with local, up-to-the- 
minute traffic conditions was one such page.
Medium Group ���������������
Pages that fell in the medium-term revisitation group were 
visited hourly (M1 ���������������) or daily (M2 /��). Pages 
revisited hourly (M1) appeared to be portals, Web mail, and 
chat, as evidenced by keywords in the URL and topic 
classification. Pages in M2 were bank pages (bank and 
credit union URLs were very common), news pages, and 
sports pages.
Popular homepages: Pages in the medium group were 
among the most easily recognizable, with many being very 
popular. The URLs were significantly shorter at a mean of 
38.3 characters (versus 48.5 and 43.2 for fast and slow 
respectively) and a mean directory depth of 2.4 (versus 3.2 
and 2.7) indicating that they were more likely to be top 
level homepages. There were many more unique visitors to 
these Web sites than to others, with a mean number of 
254.3 visitors, compared with 40 for the fast group and 75 
for the slow group. Interestingly, however, the hybrid

group displayed a similar number of unique visitors – a fact 
we return to in later discussion.
Consistent with the notion that popular sites appear in the 
medium group, in this group we find pages from search 
engines (e.g. www.google.com and search.yahoo.com) as 
well as the homepages for BBC’s news site 
(news.bbc.co.uk) and Google news (news.google.com). 
Additionally, we find medium rate revisits for URLs on 
games Web sites such as Yahoo Games (games.yahoo.com) 
and Gamesville (www.gamesville.com).
Communication (Web mail and forums): Mail and forum 
pages are over-represented in this group. This is likely due 
to the timescale of human-to-human communication. That 
is, the turnaround in communication between two 
individuals through a Web mediated system appears to be 
more on the hourly or daily basis than significantly faster or 
slower. The width of the revisitation curve for this group 
indicates that there is considerable variability (both across 
and within individuals) in revisitation intervals. Survey 
respondents further indicated that “communication” was a 
reason to access a number of Web pages in this group.
.edu domain: The medium group also contained a 
significantly higher number of educational domain Web 
pages, with 35% (440 of 1245 .edu pages in the study) of 
the URLs coming from the .edu domain (versus 28%, 31%, 
and 4% for the fast, slow, and hybrid groups respectively). 
The high representation of educational pages may reflect 
the fact that student populations are particularly likely to re- 
access Web content at daily or weekly periods.
Browser homepages: According to the survey data, most 
browser homepages fell in this group, with none falling in 
the fast group, and few in the slow group. This is consistent 
with the fact that portals and search engines, both 
frequently used as browser homepages, appear in the 
medium group.
Slow Group -J
Pages with slow revisitation patterns were visited on 
average at intervals longer than a day. These pages most 
likely represented people’s long term interests and 
infrequent information needs.
Entry pages: Many pages appeared to be product home 
pages or the entry pages for specialty search engines (e.g. 
for travel, jobs, or cars). These pages were not used in a 
hub-and-spoke manner like the pages in the fast group, but 
were perhaps used to get to such pages.
Weekend activity: Cluster S2 _�_A exhibits a peak at a 
week. We hypothesize much of the activity in this cluster is 
related to weekend activity. For example, the page 
http://www.fetenet.com, which is close to the cluster’s 
centroid, contains event listings. The Movies category is 
the most distinguishing category for this cluster, followed 
by the Religion category, both of which further suggest 
weekend activity.
Search-engines used for revisitation: One trend we noted 
across groups was that as the revisitation period increased, 
the pages were more likely to be accessed from a search
1203
CHI 2008 Proceedings · Web Visits in the Long	April 5-10, 2008 · Florence, Italy
engine. The URLs are also longer in the slow group than 
the medium group, which suggests that direct access typing 
the URL was less likely for these pages.
Child-oriented content: Interestingly, many pages for 
children’s Web sites are over-represented in the slow group. 
This includes pages for the Cartoon Network 
(www.cartoonnetwork.com), the Barbie Web site 
(barbie.everythinggirl.com), Nickelodeon (www.nick.com) 
and Disney (disney.go.com). This finding may be due to 
limited availability of Internet access for children who may 
only have access at certain times of the day or days of the 
week. Additionally, many Web sites are tied to TV 
programs which have weekly periodicities. Children’s Web 
sites also display hybrid behavior which appears to be due 
to multiple functions of the Web site, which we describe in 
more detail in the next section.
Software updates: Our survey data also revealed pages in 
the slow group were used to download software updates. 
For examples, pages with “update” in the URL or content 
included application update sites such as Microsoft 
Windows Update and McAfee Update.
Hybrid Group �\,-f
URLs in the hybrid group bore similarities to several other 
groups, as can be seen in Table 4. Much of the navigation 
behavior was similar to what was observed for the fast 
group (e.g., hub-and-spoke), but the hybrid pages appeared 
to be of higher quality and receive more long-term 
revisitations. Like the medium group, hybrid pages had 
short URLs and a large number of unique visitors (274).
Popular, but infrequently used, site homepages: It is 
interesting that the most popular Web pages, in terms of 
unique visitors, fall into two different behavior patterns— 
medium and hybrid groups. Whereas the pages occurring in 
medium group indicate a fairly constant need, hybrid 
interactions reflect a rarer need that nonetheless requires 
many page revisits for the individual need to be met. For 
example, a page such as Automart’s homepage 
(www.automart.com) provides a front end interface to 
search for new sales listings, in this case for cars. A user 
may visit the page, search for updated or new listings and 
check many listings in any given visit. The homepages for 
various classifieds listing service, such as local Craig’s List 
homepages, fall into this group as well. Both hybrid and 
medium group’s pages display a higher than expected 
number of “login[s]” in the text indicating both types are 
transactional or personalized in some way.
According to the survey participants, the amount of 
meaningful change they expected to the page decreased as 
the revisitation interval increased. Visits to hybrid pages 
were particularly likely to be to find new information (on a 
page that had previously been visited). Hybrid pages also 
displayed the greatest number of changes in content. A 
hybrid behavior might be a mechanism for “catching-up” 
with changed content. Pages in the medium group
displayed the second highest number of changes and 
indicate a potentially more regular monitoring activity.
Entertainment &amp; Hobbies: Hybrid behavior is likely 
observed in situations when an activity requires hub-and-
spoke movement around the page, but the activity itself is 
somewhat infrequent. For example certain shopping related 
pages such as shopping carts exist in this group. High-level 
auction pages are also in this group (e.g. 
computers.ebay.com, home.ebay.com, etc.). The difference 
between auction related pages, such as eBay, and other 
shopping destinations might be the requirement of 
monitoring ever-changing auctions, successive bids, and 
long-term interest in collectibles.
Another over-represented category within the hybrid group 
are “games” pages (as indicated by the page text and by the 
page categories). It is interesting —though perhaps 
unsurprising—that games are played rarely but repeatedly.
Combined Fast &amp; Slow: Unlike the medium group, the 
hybrid group received significantly fewer mean visits per 
visitor (4.9 v. 7.4). This is consistent with the observation 
that most URLs in the medium group are attached to 
constant, more generic, information needs (e.g. 
communication, news, etc.) whereas page in the hybrid 
group represent more easily satisfied needs (e.g. games, 
music, or product purchase) and are more likely a 
combination of slow (rare information need) and fast (high 
“session” revisits) .
Web Sites Across Groups
Because of large scale sampling of URL data we are able to 
also look at how pages within a Web site are distributed 
across groups. This analysis generates confirmation of the 
findings described above.
As mentioned earlier, there is an over-representation of 
URLs for shopping and reference Web sites in the fast 
group (e.g., Craigslist’s pages from Seattle and New York, 
seattle.craigslist.com and newyork.craigslist.com, Ikea at 
www.ikea.com, Kelly’s Blue Book, for pricing used cars, 
www.kbb.com, and Wikipedia at www.wikipedia.org). An 
interesting characteristic of such sites is that while a vast 
majority of the pages inside the website were in the fast 
group, their top-level homepages (e.g., 
http://www.ikea.com/ and http://www.wikipedia.org/) fell 
into the slow group. The homepage visits probably 
represent the occasional need people have for the type of 
information (Ikea furniture, encyclopedic references, or 
used car pricing), while the deeper pages that fall in the fast 
group probably represent individual’s behavior when 
satisfying the need. This suggests that while some Web 
pages themselves may fall into fast or slow groups, the Web 
sites may display hybrid or slow behavior.
In general, we find that Web sites that serve a single 
consistent role tend to be present in only one group. For 
example, BlinkYou, a predominantly fast site at 
www.blinkyou.com, provides widgets to embed in 
MySpace homepages and MSN Weather, a generally slow
1204
CHI 2008 Proceedings · Web Visits in the Long	April 5-10, 2008 · Florence, Italy
site, serves weather at weather.msn.com. Those that serve 
multiple roles have URLs that fall more equally into all 
groups. For example, EsMas, www.esmas.com, a Spanish 
language portal and media site that provides shopping, 
classifieds, news, galleries, and many other features has a 
fairly even split across groups (with no significant over-
representation in any group).
DESIGN IMPLICATIONS
Web Browser Design
Previous studies of the revisitation patterns of individual 
users have led to numerous browser enhancements [2, 11, 
13, 15, 22]. In one study, Cockburn et al. [7] explored 
presenting a user’s history as a series of Web page 
thumbnails enhanced with information about the user’s 
page visit frequency, and allowed the user to group 
thumbnails to visualize “hub-and-spoke” revisitation 
patterns. Given the results presented here, we believe there 
may be value in providing awareness of, and grouping by, a 
broader range of revisitation patterns. For example, users 
may want to quickly sort previously visited pages into 
groups corresponding to a working stack (recently accessed 
fast pages), a frequent stack (medium and hybrid pages), 
and a searchable stack (slow pages).
Several history mechanisms have tried to predict whether 
people will access a Web page based on overall measures of 
last access time and frequency of access. It may be possible 
to better predict the future utility of a URL by taking into 
account the page’s revisitation pattern. For example, if a 
page is visited weekly and the user has not visited it in 
almost seven days, it is very likely to be revisited soon. On 
the other hand, a page the user visits daily but that was just 
visited is unlikely to be visited in the immediate future.
More accurate predictions of the future utility of a Web 
page can be used in many ways. The color of the page’s 
URL could change to indicate increased potential interest, 
or the address bar’s completion drop-down list could favor 
URLs that are likely to be accessed. Alternatively, such 
pages could be proactively recommended and the content 
pre-fetched [3] for efficiency in browsing or indexing.
In order for a Web browser to take advantage of revisitation 
patterns for a page or site, aggregate visitation data could be 
made available by the site itself. If this is not feasible, it 
may be possible to predict the page’s revisitation pattern by 
classifying it using non-behavioral features like text and 
link structure. Initial explorations indicate this approach is 
promising. Personalized revisitation patterns could further 
be combined with aggregate observations or predictions.
Search Engine Implications
Revisitation analysis also has a number of implications for 
search engine design and in particular to the related issue of 
re-finding. Prior research has demonstrated re-finding 
behavior is prevalent [19, 25] in search engine use. Our 
analysis, which further demonstrates a relationship between
search and specific kinds of revisitation behavior, suggests 
several ways search engines can support re-finding.
For repeat searches, there is a tension between displaying 
new results and preserving previously viewed results [24]. 
It may be particularly important for search engines to 
provide consistent results for queries that return many slow 
and hybrid pages, since these searches are likely to be used 
to re-find pages found a long time ago. Though consistency 
can be achieved by keeping the results displayed static, it 
may be better achieved through personalization where the 
results an individual is likely to revisit are emphasized.
The revisitation patterns of pages returned for a query can 
tell the search engine something about the searcher’s 
information need. Depending on the particular task or 
distribution of results, the search engine could include 
pages that had consistent or diverse revisitation patterns.
The types of pages a person is interested in may also 
suggest how receptive that person is to new information 
(e.g. suggestions of related content or advertisements). For 
example, if a query returns results that are generally in the 
fast group, this could indicate that the user is looking for 
something new and may be particularly responsive to the 
suggestion of relevant content. On the other hand, if the 
results are primarily in the medium or slow revisit groups, 
the user may be more likely to have a specific intent and not 
respond to suggestions. Content that is somewhat 
orthogonal to the user’s objective may be most helpful in 
these cases by appealing to different interests.
Search engines may also benefit by taking into account 
users revisitation behaviors when crawling the Web. 
Assuming changes to page content are correlated with 
people’s aggregate revisitation patterns, the revisitation 
patterns could indicate the optimal rate for re-crawling and 
re-indexing different Web sites.
Web Site Design
Just as search engines may want to make it easy to find 
slow and hybrid pages, Web site designers may want to 
ensure that such pages are easy to find. This could be done 
by creating appropriate keyword lists for indexing, 
minimizing page change and movement, and providing 
navigational shortcuts from common search landing pages.
Modeling users in terms of revisitation behavior might 
allow a Web site designer to apply our results in the design 
of their site. By taking into account the four potential 
revisitation styles, in conjunction with the site design and 
content, information architects can understand and simulate 
user behavior with their Web sites. This may make it 
possible for designers to understand potential interaction 
patterns even before the Web site is launched, and to 
evaluate a site’s success in meeting the design objectives.
Finally, we believe there are opportunities for Web site 
designers to better support monitoring activities. For 
example, some Web sites create a list of “what’s new” to 
aid in repeat visitors’ discovery of new content. Our
1205
CHI 2008 Proceedings · Web Visits in the Long	April 5-10, 2008 · Florence, Italy
research shows that different pages, even on the same site, 
can have different revisitation patterns. As a result, it may 
be in the site’s interest to maintain “what’s new” lists at 
different granularities depending on the specific page.
CONCLUSION
Our paper has presented an exploration of the diverse ways 
that people revisit Web pages and the reasons behind their 
actions. Our work, which is based on the largest study to 
date of Web visitation logs coupled with user surveys and 
Web content analysis, has allowed us to develop a unique 
view of people’s revisitation behaviors. By analyzing tens 
of thousands of Web sites we have been able to identify 12 
different types of revisitation behavior corresponding to 
four groups that are orthogonal to previous work. Our 
analysis of these groups in various contexts has led us to 
define a set of design implications for client applications, 
Websites, and search engines.
Looking forward, we hope to refine and test the designs we 
have described above, and better characterize the impact of 
document change on revisitation. As can be seen in Table 
4, the amount of change to a Web page’s content that we 
observed varied greatly as a function of the group to which 
the page belonged. We believe that revisitation patterns 
and intent are likely to correlate with meaningful change. 
For example, hybrid pages were particularly likely to 
change, and survey participants indicated they were 
particularly interested in new content from these pages. We 
also believe that a study over longer periods may lead to 
interesting new insights about seasonal effects and 
periodicities.
