CHI 2008 Proceedings · On the Move	April 5-10, 2008 · Florence, Italy
The equipment must be ‘just right’ in preparedness for the 
ready signal, as well as being relatively comfortable for the 
rider. This takes a significant amount of time and operator 
H has at this point already spent several minutes getting to 
point at which it is possible perform the next task. This 
second phase of readying involves testing the various 
functions of the equipment. This takes a further few 
minutes.
{11} Operator H: [Walks back away from Sam and guides 
her into a position] Could you stand here for a 
second, and just stand this way exactly that way [ ... ] 
Operator H: [Speaking into radio, oriented towards 
main building] Hello err we’ve got everything 
switched on are you getting data? [ ... ] You getting 
the video as well? Shall we test audio [...] [To Sam] 
So the err just count or something
{12} Sam: [Looking at Operator H] 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 I’m really 
scared at the moment I’m going to crap myself any 
minute now [ ... ]
Operator H: Just count again
Sam: Okay 1 2 3 4 5 6 7
[Sam continues counting several times whilst 
Operator H talks with upstairs]
Operator H: Confirmed ok that’s fine thanks [Turns 
towards Sam, nodding] S’alright
[Sam stops counting]
{13} Sam: Okay you’re going to make me talk and stuff oh 
brilliant oh dear
The equipment is now designated as working. Sam, 
operator H and the others must wait in readiness for the 
signal to start the ride.
{14} Operator H: [to Sam] We’ve got about 10 minutes but 
yesterday it varied by a lot so I hope it will just be 10 
minutes.
This sequence shows the considerable time and work 
required to get the rider and equipment to a state of 
readiness. The rider must stand at particular orientations so 
as to align aerials (“stand this way exactly”) for lengthy 
periods conducting tests in concert with operator H. After 
further waiting, the signal is given to operator H who then 
suggests they “go on” the ride. The group climbs the steps 
onto the base of the Booster, with Sam and Anne coming to 
be seated on the ride itself. As Sam is seated, operator H 
has to carefully remove the helmet, pass it through the 
bulky seat harness and reattach it once again. Trailing 
wires, battery levels and so on then have to be checked 
again. Sam and Anne wait for the ride to begin, chatting.
{15} Sam: It’s really cold isn’t it. Brrr. [ ... ] Is this all part 
of the thing to like proper heighten our senses or 
something so we’re really screwed up before we go on 
it? Do you offer post-traumatic stress counselling 
sessions?
We can contrast Sam’s experience with that of a normal 
rider. There are a number of practicalities which impact her: 
there is considerable waiting to be done, both on and off the 
ride; she feels the cold (in this instance); she must spend 
time donning and getting comfortable in the equipment, and
taking part in testing it. The build-up to the ride here is 
greater and longer than usual, and is clearly seen by Sam as 
heightening her anticipation. We also note how the audio 
testing reinforces the idea that she is meant to commentate 
on her experience.
Finally the signal is given that the presentations upstairs 
have come to a close and that the audience is ready. Sam 
begins talking as the ride’s steps retract, with the ground 
staff present on the lawn watching.
{16} Sam: Umm helloo um I’m sitting on the ride slightly 
scared but um really really excited so it should be 
cool. If I die, I love you all. [ ... ] Shall I just keep 
talking? Oh. The ride’s about to start! Ok we’re 
currently going up oh this is so cool! [ ... ] We’re kinda 
hanging forwards and um we’re coming down to the 
ground we’re going quite slow at the moment. I’m 
absolutely fine at the moment. Okay yeah they’re 
speeding up a bit now, this is absolutely brilliant. Um 
yeah quite high. Oooh! [high scream] Okay that was 
cool. Oh my good [...] Wow! [screams] Woohoo! 
Woohoo! Waa
[Video cuts out]
Sam: [shouting] Oh my gosh! This is so cool. Oh 
wow. This is the most amazing [inaudible] ever. 
[screams] woohoo woohoo! wooooooh! Oh wow this is 
fantastic mate. Ah you gotta come on this absolutely 
brilliant. Woo hoo! You alright Anne? Woo hoo hoo! 
This is absolutely wicked! Oh this is so good! ha ha ha 
woo hoo! I was afraid of heights not any more! Get 
in! [inaudible] Oh wow woo so far from the ground it’s 
wicked! [ ... ] Okay we’re coming to a stop now. Like 
that one, yeah, you should give it a go. Woo! Can we 
go again?
After the ride comes to a stop, Sam and Anne are helped off 
by operator H. Like Alan in the previous vignette, Sam is 
broadcasting to the unseen-but-assumed audience. Similarly 
to Alan she also begins by providing a running-commentary 
of her experience until she breaks into less controlled 
screaming and exclaiming as the ride speeds up. After this, 
when the ride has slowed down somewhat, she encourages 
the audience to have a go on the ride.
Vignette 3: Crisis in the control room
In our final vignette, we turn our focus to the control area in 
the main auditorium, during a time after both Alan and Sam 
have been on the Booster. The audience are now on the lawn 
in front of the ride, either queuing, on the ride itself, or 
spectating. Also on the lawn is operator H, helping a (female) 
rider who has volunteered herself from the queue to don the 
equipment. Operators A, S, T and J are in the control area.
{17} Operator S: Yeah I can hear audio
Operator A: We have err audio. Do we have ECG and 
accelerometer?
Operator S: No not yet
Operator A: Not even accelerometer cos I don’t think 
he turned that off
[ ... ]
Operator H: Hello there what’s the reception like?
