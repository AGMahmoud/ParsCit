tasks) and the field study participants (40.67% of field 
study tasks) which we believe is due to the timing of each 
study; the diary study was run after a winter/spring term 
and the field study was run in the middle of a fall term.
We subdivided general topic search (28.09% of the tasks) 
into four sub-groups: looking for instructions or directions 
(e.g., how to use Skype or how to start a university society), 
looking up information, relocation (e.g., job hunting), and 
entertainment (e.g., reading up on world soccer). Research 
tasks (10.64% of the total tasks) had longer time lines and 
involved searching for a similar topic over several sessions. 
Travel/tourism tasks (8.94%) involved such actions as 
planning vacations and making conference arrangements. 
Project tasks (8.09%) lasted for longer periods and always 
contained sub-tasks. Action-based tasks (7.66%) involved 
transactions, such as completing online surveys and 
transferring money. Shopping (5.96%) included a variety of 
products, such as sandals and a laptop and involved actions 
such as price comparisons between web sites, bidding on 
eBay, emailing friends for feedback, and tracking 
shipments. For status checking (2.13%), participants 
continually checked on some information (e.g., watching 
for a cheque that was to be deposited to their bank account 
or checking for an updated course schedule).
Sub-task Types
When examining how participants worked on the task 
during each web session, we found there to be a series of 
sub-tasks within each task (for example, see Table 2 and 
Table 3 for sample study tasks and their sub-tasks). As 
Table 9 illustrates, there were a total of 428 sub-tasks 
recorded over both studies and interestingly, some of these 
sub-tasks also occurred over more than one session (e.g., 
booking flights was often done over several sessions in 
order to compare schedules and cost). The sub-tasks were

classified using the previously defined categories of web 
tasks of Kellar et al.[12]. We arranged these sub-tasks as 
follows: 228 as information gathering (53.27%), 119 as fact 
finding tasks (27.80%), 46 as transactions (10.75%), 21 as 
communication (4.91%), and 14 as maintenance (3.27%). 
We did not include browsing as it is considered a 
serendipitous act [11] usually performed for entertainment 
purposes. While some counts differed, we saw similar 
numbers for the different types of subtasks in the studies. 
One reason for the larger number of maintenance type 
subtasks in the diary study may be because there were 
university employees who were responsible for tasks 
involving the Web. In some cases, more than one type of 
sub-task occurred during a single session (e.g., during one 
session for the task “Attend Conference” in the diary study, 
the participant filled in the registration form and gathered 
accommodation details).
DISCUSSION
The main goal of the diary study and field study was to gain 
a better understanding of how participants perform multi- 
session tasks and to help characterize these tasks. A 
secondary goal of these studies was to provide data for 
researchers, including ourselves, to help in designing 
browser tools and/or in designing improvements for 
existing browser tools for multi-session tasks.
For both studies, we conducted post-study interviews where 
we demonstrated browser tools that we felt might be useful 
when working on multi-session tasks. This demonstration 
of the tools prompted participants into a discussion on the 
types of tools or features of tools that they thought would 
be helpful in performing multi-session tasks. We 
demonstrated tabs (to diary study participants who never 
used tabs), session saver (a Firefox extension that saves and 
reopens tabs), Landmarks [14], page annotations 
(www.mystickies.com) and Google Notebook (adds 
snippets of different web pages that can be shared) to the 
field study participants only.
Many of the suggestions for tools were repeated by the 
participants. The different suggestions for tools included 
improving bookmarks to include an automated system to 
create bookmark folders (e.g., based on search terms) and to 
remove bookmarks based on a user inputted expiry date. 
Other suggestions included having text editors in the 
browser, associating and organizing different types of
