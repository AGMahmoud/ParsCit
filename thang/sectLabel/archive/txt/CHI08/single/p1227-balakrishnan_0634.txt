.05 level between the two best conditions—Full Access 
Visualization and Unshared Visualizations versus the No 
Visualization controls.
To test whether visualization helped the collaboration over 
and above the help it gave individual members of each pair, 
we conducted a nominal pairs analysis [43]. For this 
analysis, we compared actual problem solving success of 
each pair in each condition with the simulated success of all 
possible other pairs in the same condition. The idea here 
was to compare these nominal (in name only) pairs with the 
actual pairs, to evaluate the extent to which collaboration 
really mattered when visualization was given to pairs. The 
results of this analysis can be seen in Figure 3. They show 
that, controlling for condition, performance was worse by 
nominal pairs than by actual pairs (logistic regression 
Likelihood Ratio x2 = 3.04, p = .08). In nominal pairs, the 
top mean performance in the Shared Full Access 
Visualization condition was only 48% (SE = 14.4). These 
analyses indicate that although visualizations aided 
individuals, collaborative performance was superior and 
benefited from using the visualization tool.
The results support Hypothesis 1 and show that 
visualization increases collaborative performance but the 
comparatively weak performance of the pairs in the Shared 
View-Only Visualization condition suggests that features of 
the tool do matter. The next section delves into the 
different tool use and communication in the three 
visualization conditions, and tests of Hypotheses 2 and 3.
Visualization Tool Use and Communication
We predicted that access to a visualization tool would 
increase remote pair performance in complex problem 
solving when this access increased information sharing and 
discussion by the pair (Hypothesis 2). The first step was to 
establish that participants with access to the visualization 
tool actually used it. They did. In the No Visualization 
condition, on average, participants spent 2.7 minutes with 
the spreadsheet selected. By contrast, in the Visualization 
conditions, participants on average spent 5.7 minutes with 
the network diagram opened (F [3, 43] = 4.1, p = .01, d = 
.63). Pairs in the two Shared Visualization conditions used 
the visualization tool more than did the pairs in the 
Unshared Visualization condition (F [2, 44] = 3.36, p &lt; 
0.05, d = .57). As shown in Figure 4, Shared View-Only 
Visualization pairs used the visualization tool the most (M 
= 6.84 minutes, SE = 1.02), followed by Shared Full Access 
Visualization pairs (M = 5.14 minutes, SE = 0.89), and then 
Unshared Visualization pairs (M = 2.83 minutes, SE = 
0.54). A contrast revealed that this difference was 
significant when comparing both shared conditions against 
the unshared condition (F [1, 30] = 6.37, p &lt; 0.05, d = .69). 
These results indicate that access to shared visualizations 
does encourage tool use.
Hypothesis 3 stated that the Shared Full Access 
Visualization would promote discussion and joint problem 
solving. We thus tested whether the participants in the
Visualization conditions, particularly in the Shared Full 
Access condition communicated differently than those in 
the other conditions. We found no overall effect on the total 
amount of IM conversation in the pairs, but a significant 
effect on talking about the network diagram versus the 
spreadsheet (F [3, 43] = 2.8, p &lt; .05, d = .52; see Figure 5).
