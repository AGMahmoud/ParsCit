research shows that different pages, even on the same site, 
can have different revisitation patterns. As a result, it may 
be in the site’s interest to maintain “what’s new” lists at 
different granularities depending on the specific page.
CONCLUSION
Our paper has presented an exploration of the diverse ways 
that people revisit Web pages and the reasons behind their 
actions. Our work, which is based on the largest study to 
date of Web visitation logs coupled with user surveys and 
Web content analysis, has allowed us to develop a unique 
view of people’s revisitation behaviors. By analyzing tens 
of thousands of Web sites we have been able to identify 12 
different types of revisitation behavior corresponding to 
four groups that are orthogonal to previous work. Our 
analysis of these groups in various contexts has led us to 
define a set of design implications for client applications, 
Websites, and search engines.
Looking forward, we hope to refine and test the designs we 
have described above, and better characterize the impact of 
document change on revisitation. As can be seen in Table 
4, the amount of change to a Web page’s content that we 
observed varied greatly as a function of the group to which 
the page belonged. We believe that revisitation patterns 
and intent are likely to correlate with meaningful change. 
For example, hybrid pages were particularly likely to 
change, and survey participants indicated they were 
particularly interested in new content from these pages. We 
also believe that a study over longer periods may lead to 
interesting new insights about seasonal effects and 
periodicities.
