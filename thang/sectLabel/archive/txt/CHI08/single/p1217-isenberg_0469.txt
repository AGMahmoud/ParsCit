Scenario	Task	Type
1) Give a short description of the participants’ characteristics.
2) Who should each breakfast option be advertised to?
3) Do more females prefer oatmeal than active people prefer cereal.
4) Do more inactive people prefer oatmeal than people over 60? Do you think there might be a relationship 
between lifestyle and age in terms of preference for oatmeal?

1) Find pairs of behaviours that have similar ratings in at least three different situations.
2) Choose three situations and describe behaviours most appropriate for that situation.
3) Find two situations that have at least five behaviours with similar ratings.
4) Is it more appropriate to argue or belch in a park?
5) Where was it most appropriate to laugh.
6) What behaviour in which situation was most appropriate and which was most inappropriate.

Our sample size was informed by emerging results. After 
four pilot studies and 12 groups we were confident that fur-
ther observations would result in redundant data.

Apparatus
Participants worked on a large table (90 × 150 cm) and were 
given 15 × 10 cm cards, each showing one data chart. The 
table was covered with a large paper sheet, and several pens, 
pencils, rulers, erasers, scissors, and sticky notes were pro-
vided. Six different types of charts were used. These charts 
showed different subsets of the data and each data subset 
was shown in at least two different representations (e. g., line 
chart and bar chart). Figure 2 gives an overview of the charts 
used and shows how many participants reported themselves 
to be unfamiliar with a given chart; however, data was al-
ways redundantly encoded in familiar charts.

Tasks
Participants worked on two task scenarios, each composed 
of a different data set with its own representations. The data
sets used in the study are part of the sample files provided 
with the analysis software SPSS 14.0. The behaviour data 
set (Scenario B, behavior.sav in SPSS) included 32 charts (1 
stacked area, 1 line, 15 scatter plots, 15 bar charts). The data 
shown in these charts was about ratings for the appropriate-
ness of 15 behaviours in 15 different situations (e. g., running 
in church). The cereal data set (Scenario C, cereal.sav in 
SPSS) which included 30 charts (3 pie, 9 bar, 9 stacked bar, 
9 line charts) was about an imagined study of preferences for 
certain breakfast options. No specialized knowledge about 
the data was required to solve the tasks and high task en-
gagement was evident throughout the observations. The pre-
sentation order of these scenarios was counter-balanced be-
tween groups. Similar to the design used in [10], our sce-
narios each contained an equal number of open discovery 
tasks, where tasks could have several possible solutions, and 
focused question tasks which had only one correct answer. 
An overview of all tasks can be found in Table 1.
Procedure
Participants were greeted and then seated themselves around 
the table. Next, a short tutorial was provided on the types 
of charts, tasks, and scenarios used in the study. Partici-
pants were told that they could use any of the tools (pens, 
rulers, etc.) to work with the charts, and that they could 
write on anything as they saw fit (e. g., cards, scrap paper, 
table, etc.). Participants were then given an example task 
scenario to clarify the process. Once it was clear how to 
proceed, each task scenario was given in turn, and the partic-
ipants were instructed to work on the tasks in any way they 
felt comfortable. Upon completing both task scenarios, par-
ticipants filled out a questionnaire asking them about their 
experiences during the study and to collect demographic in-
formation. The groups of two and three participants natu-
rally discussed their tasks and progress and single partici-
pants were asked to use a “talk aloud” protocol.
Data Collection and Analysis
During each session two observers were always present. Both 
observers collected notes, and each session was video or au-
dio taped. 610 minutes of video data was collected (,: 50
minutes for each session). Our multi-pass open coding anal-
ysis was based on both the collected notes and the video data.
Both observers used notes and video samples to form initial
coding categories. These were used by one observer for the
first video coding pass and were refined through subsequent
study of the videos and the second coding pass.
