the internet, are still in their diffusion phase and are not yet 
used by all. However, they are gaining momentum and have 
become quite prevalent. As we wanted to compare all 
sources, we decided to focus on users who use all of the 
chosen data sources. While such users are not a statistical 
sample, we refer to them as the early adopters of the 
technologies, and use their figures as a reflection of the 
potential of SN information that may be extracted from 
public sources as Web 2.0 technologies become ubiquitous 
[24].
We started by locating the top 1000 heavy users of each of 
the tools (BlogCentral, Fringe, and Dogear). For blogs, we 
defined heavy users as those who received most comments 
in their blog. For Fringe we took the 1000 users with the 
largest lists of connections. For Dogear, the 1000 people 
with most bookmarks. Once we had these three lists, we 
took their union and received a list of 1761 users. We then 
obtained results from the different SONAR providers for all 
1761 users, and examined those users who had a nonempty 
result in all four sources (the fourth source being the 
organizational chart). We ended up with a list of 273 such 
users. For every one of the four public sources and every 
one of the 273 users, we calculated the number of unique 
contributions of this source over the union of all other three 
sources.
Experiment 2: Online Questionnaire for Ranking Buddylists 
For the second experiment we implemented a dedicated 
plugin for Lotus Sametime. The plugin was easy to install 
and presented a questionnaire containing three sets of up to 
eight buddylists that were aggregated from the different 
sources and tailored specifically for the user. The user could 
not tell what the sources of the different lists had been. 
Before starting the experiment, we asked the user to 
imagine setting up an “ideal” buddylist for communication 
inside IBM. By this request, we framed the experiment to a 
basic scenario. The user was then asked to rank the 
buddylists by how close they were to representing the ideal 
buddylist. The scale for ranking was 1-4 (where “1” is 
good, and “4” is bad). In addition, we asked the user to 
mark a single buddylist as the “best” buddylist – relative to 
the other lists in that set.
The first set of up to eight buddylists was composed solely
from public sources. Our goal with this set was to examine 
the value of extracting SN information from public sources 
(hypothesis (2)), and to compare the quality of lists created 
by aggregation of different sources vs. the quality of lists 
created from a single source. The weight combinations of 
sources used in this set are displayed in the leftmost 
columns of Table 2 (1-8). We use the term “up to eight 
lists”, since if two different combinations created two 
identical lists (in both content and order), we only presented 
them once. If the user voted “best” for a list that was 
created from more than one combination, we added a vote 
to all these combinations.
The second set of buddylists was also focused on public 
sources. The goal with this set was to learn whether a 
specific weight combination is preferred by most users and 
may serve as a default (hypothesis (5)). The weight 
combinations of sources used in this set are displayed in the 
rightmost columns of Table 2 (9-16).
The last set of buddylists introduced information gathered 
from the user’s private sources. The goal of this set was to 
examine the value of information public sources add over 
private sources (hypothesis (3)), as well as to study the 
effect aggregation has on the lists (hypothesis (4)) – 
aggregation of private sources, and aggregation of a mix of 
private and public sources. The weight combinations of 
sources used in this set are displayed in Table 5 (17-24).
Our plugin reported the user ranking of the buddylists to a 
dedicated server that produced a report with all results. The 
results visible to us did not contain any private information 
nor could we see the buddylists, we only examined the 
ranks (1-4) and the vote for best list in each set.
Experiment 3: Sliders UI for Personal Weight Combination
A set of interviews we conducted, helped us examine 
hypotheses (2), (4), and (6), as well as hypothesis (5). It 
also gave us some insight about how people perceive their 
SN and what they feel about our UI.
The preferences-page of the SONAR plugin allows 
modifying the weight combination of different sources with 
sliders and simultaneously seeing a preview of the buddylist 
created from this combination. The user interface of this 
feature is shown in Figure 2.
