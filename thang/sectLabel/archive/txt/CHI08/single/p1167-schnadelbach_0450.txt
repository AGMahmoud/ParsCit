CHI 2008 Proceedings · On the Move	April 5-10, 2008 · Florence, Italy
{4} Alan: Uhh okay I’m assuming you can hear me. And 
it’s pretty cold out here [audience laughs]. [ ... ] it’s 
going to be an interesting ride. And [inaudible] get 
spun around and it’s actually quite a pleasant 
sensation. The view up here is phenomenal. And the 
ground comes rushing towards you pretty quickly 
here I’m not really going fast yet so...
It is notable that Alan mentions the ride’s slowness. The 
ride was, in fact, intentionally run slowly at the beginning 
as experience had shown that this increased the reliability 
of wireless communications, providing stability during the 
moments when Brian ‘hands over’ to Alan. As a 
professional rider, Alan has already been on the ride many 
times, but each time he must describe his experience anew. 
Although he can talk to his audience he cannot see or hear 
them in return and so must broadcast himself to unseen-but-
assumed audience.
Alan now continues his reportage. However, as the ride 
speeds up so his talk begins to feature more exclamation 
than description.
{5} Alan: And I’ve started to rotate oh here it goes and 
I’m upside-down ooohh! [Audience laughs]
Brian: Brian to Tim [an operator outside] can you go 
faster please?
[Audience laugh]
Alan: The ground’s [inaudible] very quickly!
[Audience laugh]
Although it is in the planned schedule of events that the ride 
will indeed speed up after a short period, Brian theatrically 
highlights this moment to the audience. Brian’s statement 
transforms what might normally be a private coordination 
between the crew into a public one.
At this point there is sudden silence as the video freezes and 
audio drops out. The audience laughs and starts talking 
amongst itself, with some audience members at the back 
looking out the small windows to the ride itself.
{6} Host: Have we lost him?
Brian: Are we... I think we’ve lost Alan [laughs] 
[Video resumes and Alan can be heard laughing] 
Host: No he’s back
Brian: Oh no he’s back
[Audience laugh]
Alan: Wohoo!
[Video and audio freeze again]
Brian: Ooh...
Brian and the host comment on what is observable to the 
audience, such as “losing” Alan (i.e., the audiovisual stream 
freezing), getting him “back” (i.e., resumption of the 
audiovisual stream) and finally “losing” him yet again. It is 
part of the performative work of Brian and the Host to 
weave Alan’s broadcast into the ongoing trajectory of the 
performance, highlighting his comments, covering during 
disconnections, and fading him in and out as necessary.
{7} Brian: Okay I’ll get him off the ride now I think he’s 
had enough. Okay can we let err let Alan off please? 
[Video and audio begin to work again]
Alan: I can’t really talk [fades out]
As we saw earlier, Alan’s more sober description became 
more interspersed with laughter and exclamation. Here 
Alan states as he is faded out that he is finding it difficult to 
talk. Even though Alan is a ‘professional rider,’ there are 
times when he may ‘lose control’ to some extent due to the 
extreme physical nature of the experience.
Finally, Trevor returns to briefly describe Alan’s heart rate, 
explaining that he can “start to relax now”, highlighting the 
decrease with his hand once again. Brian then closes the 
performance.
{8} Brian: Brilliant that was Alan on the Booster! [Claps] 
[Audience claps]
Vignette 2: Sam – the public lottery winner
In our second vignette, a member of the public, Sam, has 
won an opportunity to ride the Booster in the public lottery. 
Her friend Anne joins her for the ride. Sam has been guided 
downstairs and towards the lawn in front of the ride in order 
to put on the necessary equipment (see Figure 1, bottom). 
Also present are operators H, J (filming), and operator F, 
who in this case is female so as to avoid potential 
embarrassment when fitting sensors to Sam’s torso. 
Standing near the ride, and after a short moment of 
discussion about the cold and “nerves”, Sam begins to don 
the equipment, the first element of which is the heart 
monitor.
{9} Operator F: We need we need to attach these 
[holding up patch] here and here on your skin so I’ll 
do that over here
At this point Sam and operator F, who step away from the 
main group, creating a more private area in which Sam is 
facing away from the group as the sensors are placed on her 
torso. The setup procedure continues as operator H now 
helps Sam into the jacket and helmet.
{10} Operator H [Moves around to the side of Sam, holding 
the helmet’s camera]: Is that relatively even? Does 
that fit? [Operator H moves round the back again] 
Sam: Yeah yeah it’s a bit it’s a bit loose [moves 
helmet around with hands]
[ ... ]
Operator H [moving round to side of Sam again]: 
We’ll [inaudible] the strap as well
Sam: OK that’d be good
[ ... ]
Operator H: Now we need to attach these to the 
sensors [to Operator F] you put those just here 
[places palms on side of his torso]
[ ... ]
Operator H: [Stands up straight now, steps back from 
the jacket] Now let me see we’ve got everything
As the first part of the donning procedure comes to a close, 
operator H physically steps back to appraise the situation.
