others. Understanding these changes in perception and 
behavior is a rich area for further research.
While our data collection provided a great deal of 
qualitative information on how participants used Social TV 
2, we have no data on when participants were home, when 
they were in a room from which they could observe the 
ambient indicators, or who was using the system at any 
particular moment in time. This limits our ability to 
interpret the log data. In upcoming studies we plan to 
include a control condition, to provide a baseline against 
which changes in behavior can be detected.
We continue to iterate on the design of the Social TV 
prototype. Given the tendency of our participants to seek 
progressively deeper engagement and richer 
communication, we have now integrated support for voice 
and text chatting, and are currently preparing another field 
trial with these features included. We are also considering 
other form factors for the ambient devices, and changing 
the kinds of information these devices display. However, 
one change we are not going to make is eliminating the 
ambient information. Our findings spoke clearly to us about 
the attractive nature of ambient awareness, and we intend to 
keep using this feature to promote TV-based sociability.
