Inter-relations of uses and gratifications
Despite the fact that these factors arise from an orthogonal 
rotation and are separable in terms of item loadings, they 
are correlated (see Table 9).
The Spearman correlations between the factors suggest that 
the uses and gratifications identified are related, in some 
cases relatively strongly.

User demographics and uses and gratifications
A MANOVA test found a significant difference between 
males and females on their scores across the seven uses and 
gratifications scales (F (7, 233) = 2.662, p &lt; 0.02). Further 
analysis of the between-subjects effects on the dependent 
variables showed that scores were significantly different on 
the first factor – ‘social connection’ (F (1, 239) = 16.16, 
p&lt;0.001, η2= .063), with females scoring higher on the 
scale (M = 5.40, SD = 1.22) compared to males (M = 4.70, 
SD = 1.37), on the third factor - ‘photographs’ (F (1, 239) = 
8.95, p&lt;0.01, 112= .036), with females again scoring higher 
on the scale (M = 4.67, SD = 1.61) compared to males (M = 
4.02, SD = 1.51). There was a marginally significant 
difference across the seventh factor – ‘status updates’ (F (1, 
239) = 3.26, p=.072, r)2= .0 13), with females scoring higher 
on the scale (M = 3.94, SD = 1.40) compared to males (M = 
3.58, SD = 1.47).
A one-way between subjects ANOVA found a significant 
effect of gender on profile privacy settings (F (1, 236) = 
12.29, p &lt; .01), with females more likely to report making 
their profile more private (Mean = 4.83, SD = 1.60) 
compared to males (Mean = 4.01, SD = 1.86)
A further MANOVA test was conducted to compare 
responses to the items in light of occupational status (i.e. 
full-time student, full-time employed, part-time 
student/employed). Given the relatively low number of 
people working part-time / studying part-time, this group 
was excluded from the analysis. The results showed a 
significant overall effect of occupational status on uses and
gratifications of Facebook (F (7, 217) = 4.93, p &lt; .001), 
with significant effects for Factor 1 (social connection – F 
(1, 223) = 7.3 1, p&lt;.01), Factor 2 (shared identities – F (1, 
223) = 4.90, p&lt;.05), and Factor 3 (photographs – F (1, 223) 
= 7.85, p&lt; .01).
Full-time students scored higher on social connection and 
photographs, and lower on shared identities, compared to 
those in full-time work (Factor 1 Mean = 5.38 (SD = 1.16) 
for students, Mean = 4.89 (SD = 1.45) for full-time 
employment; Factor 2 Mean = 3.47 (SD = 1.37) for 
students, Mean = 3.90 (SD = 1.40) for full-time 
employment; Factor 3 Mean = 4.71 (SD = 1.53) for 
students, Mean = 4.09 (SD = 1.57) for full-time 
employment).
Age also correlated negatively with their scores on social 
connection (rs(225) = -.27, p&lt;.001), and photographs (rs(225) = 
-.32, p&lt;.001), with younger respondents scoring higher on 
both scales. Age did not correlate with the other factor- 
derived scales.
Age also correlated with the length of time users had been 
registered on Facebook (rs(241) = -.17, p&lt;0.01), the regularity 
with which they visited the site (rs(241) = -.18, p&lt;.01), the 
number of hours they used the site in a week (rs(241) = -.22, 
p&lt;.01) and the number of friends they had linked to their 
profile (rs(219) = -.37, p&lt;.001). In all cases, a younger user 
was associated with higher usage levels, and a greater 
number of ‘friends’.
Age was also negatively correlated with the use of privacy 
settings (rs(238) = -.17, p&lt;.01), such that younger users report 
that they were more likely to have increased the privacy of 
their profile. In part this may be due to the higher number 
of friends amongst younger users.
Predicting Facebook use
A number of earlier researchers have predicted that certain 
uses and gratifications of Facebook may be associated with 
greater use of the site. For instance, [17] note that 
completion of certain profile elements is associated with a 
greater number of ‘friends’, while the findings of [16]) 
suggest that the use of Facebook for social searching and 
surveillance motivates use.
To examine possible motivators for use of Facebook, a 
series of multiple regression equations were calculated 
using scores on the seven factor-based scales to predict both 
the frequency of visits to the site and the time spent on 
Facebook during an average week. Age, occupation and 
gender were also entered as covariates (part-time excluded). 
The results of the regression analyses to predict the 
frequency of site use are shown in Table 10. The overall 
model was significant (F (10, 213) = 4.77, p&lt;0.001, R2 = 
.15).
A second regression equation examined the same variables 
predicting the amount of time spent on the site (see Table
