Participants also seemed to frequently impose categorizations 
on data items by organizing them spatially in the workspace. 
During browsing, overview layouts were often created in 
which the cards were spread across the whole workspace. 
Mainly during selection and at the end of an operation pro-
cess, information artefacts were organized in piles in the 
workspace. These piles seemed to have inherent categories 
and varied greatly in size, lifespan, and semantic. Allow-
ing users to impose a spatial organization of the informa-
tion artefacts in the workspace should be considered in the 
design of information visualization systems. These spatial 
organizations can help users support their mental model of 
the available information. Systems like CoMotion [11] are 
already taking a step in this direction but the typical informa-
tion visualization system still relies on a fixed set of windows 
and controls that can rarely be changed, piled, or relocated.
CONCLUSION
Several researchers have contributed to creating a theoretical 
understanding of how individuals make use of information 
visualizations to gain insight into data and solve problems. 
In this paper, we have continued our evolving theoretical un-
derstanding of this process by presenting a framework for 
visual information analysis. Our framework is based on find-
ings from an observational study that was designed to un-
cover the processes involved in collaborative and individual 
activities around information visualizations in a non-digital 
setting. We identified eight processes as part of this frame-
work: Browse, Parse, Discuss Collaboration Style, Establish 
Task-Specific Strategy, Clarify, Select, Operate, and Validate 
and described differences in team and individual work dur-
ing these processes. We have shown how these eight pro-
cesses relate to other models of information analysis, and 
provided insights on differences and commonalities between 
them. Yet, while others have posited a general temporal flow 
of information analysis, our results suggest this temporal 
flow may simply reflect an assumption in the design of ex-
isting information visualization tools. Thus, we argue that 
designers should allow for individuals’ unique approaches 
toward analysis, and support a more flexible temporal flow 
of activity. These eight processes can, therefore, be seen as 
an analytic framework that has implications for the design, 
heuristic evaluation, and analysis of individual and collabo-
rative information visualization systems. We have also given 
concrete design implications for digital information visual-
ization systems derived from our findings.
