such systems remain wearable so that they can sense people 
before and after the ride experience and can easily transfer 
between other rides? Here we speculate that the medium 
term approach will be to embed them in rides, but that in 
the long term there may be advantages in integrating them 
with future wearable health monitoring, sports and leisure 
equipment. A second issue for scale concerns the spectator 
interface; should these be large public displays or might it 
be better to flexibly route different riders’ data streams to 
smaller groups of mobile devices?
Beyond this, there may be greater potential to use 
biosensing data to drive different aspects of the experience, 
for example providing useful cues for identifying key 
moments of an experience as part of automatically editing 
souvenir videos, or perhaps even enabling new rides that 
directly adapt themselves to a rider’s level of excitement. In 
spite of several early explorations of using biosensing to 
either evaluate or control entertainment and other 
applications within HCI (e.g., [3,9,10,14]), developing such 
applications requires a far deeper understanding of the 
nature of biosensing in relation to experience that we have 
at present – especially where humans are in a feedback loop 
involving extreme movements – providing a challenging 
but certainly intriguing direction for long-term research.
