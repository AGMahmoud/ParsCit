repeated-measures ANOVA tests and Tukey HSD post hoc 
tests at a 5% confidence level.
Primary Driving Task Performance
We included two variables for measuring primary driving 
performance namely lateral control (lane excursions, 
steering wheel input, etc) and longitudinal control (speed 
maintenance, acceleration). We identified 182 incidents of 
lateral or longitudinal control errors in the 48 sessions.
compared to the tactile and the gesture subjects. This can 
partly be explained by the fact that one specific task was 
much easier to solve using the touch interaction system’s 
informative display compared to the tactile interaction 
(smaller display) or gesture interaction (no display), which 
is also reflected in the deviation values for average per task 
values. However, omitting this particular task would not 
alter the statistical significant difference between the task 
completion times of the three interaction techniques.

Figure 7. Lateral control and longitudinal control errors for 
each interaction technique.
While numbers of longitudinal errors were relatively alike 
for the three interaction techniques, we found a significant 
difference between the numbers for lateral control, F(2, 45) 
= 9.52, p &lt; .001. A Tukey HSD post hoc test revealed that 
the tactile interaction resulted in significantly more lateral 
control errors than both the touch and gesture interaction 
sessions (p &lt; .01). Four subjects did not make any errors 
while using touch interaction compared to three subjects for 
gesture interaction and none for tactile interaction.
Secondary Driving Task Performance
In addition to primary driving performance, we adapted a 
number of secondary driving performance measures namely 
interaction errors and task completion times. 1440 tasks 
(16 participants x 30 tasks x 3 interfaces) were assigned 
during the experiment. The result shows only marginal 
difference in interaction errors between the three interaction 
types and no significant differences were identified, F(2, 
45) = 0.03, p &gt; .97 (see figure 8).
Task efficiency was expressed by the total task completion 
time used for each of the systems (for 16 x 30 assignments) 
in seconds. The time spent on task execution is significantly 
different between the three systems according to a one-way 
repeated measures ANOVA, F(2, 45) = 65.53, p &lt; .0001. 
Post hoc tests showed that the total task completion times 
was significantly lower for the touch interaction subjects

Eye Glance Behavior
Eye glances were categorized into three categories (under 
0.5 seconds, 0.5 – 2.0 seconds, above 2.0 seconds) inspired 
by [19, 24, 25]. From the 48 driving sessions, we identified 
2657 eye glances. Using the tactile interaction, subjects had 
the most eye glances with 1,120. The touch interaction 
produced 1021 (roughly 9% less eye glances compared to 
the tactile interaction) while the gesture interaction 
produced 516 eye glances (which corresponds to 54% less 
eye glances compared to the tactile interaction). Figure 9 
illustrated number of eye glances for each of the three eye 
glance categories.
The gesture interaction accounted for approximately 19 % 
of all eye glances, while tactile and touch interaction 
accounted for 42% and 39%. A one-way repeated-measures 
ANOVA showed significant difference between the number 
of eye glances for the interaction technique, F(2, 45) = 38.4, 
p &lt; .0001. This indicates that the gesture interaction led to 
fewer eye glances. A post-hoc test showed significant 
difference at the 1% level between the gesture interaction 
and the two other techniques. The gesture subjects varied 
highly on numbers of eye glances ranging from 9 to 96 eye 
glances to complete the 30 tasks.
Category one eye glances (less than 0.5 seconds) were less 
common when using tactile and touch interaction (with 60 
and 64 respectively) compared to gesture interaction, which
