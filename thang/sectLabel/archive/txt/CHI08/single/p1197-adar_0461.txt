For every bin, i:
(normalized) revisit-curveurl[i] = counturl[i] / centroid[i]
Roughly speaking, the normalized revisitation curve for 
each URL represents the percentage over, or under, revisits 
to that URL compared to the average revisit pattern. 
Though there are a number of other ways to normalize this 
type of data (normalize to 0-1 range, subtract out the 
centroid, etc.) we find that our mechanism works well in 
practice and allows us to simultaneously compare and 
group the different behavior patterns in our study.
Examples of revisitation curves for two specific URLs are:
•	---&apos;\ http://www.amazon.com/ has a revisit curve that 
peaks towards the right, indicating that most revisits 
occur after a longer time period (over a day).
•	d*­������ http://www.cnn.com/ displays a peak on the left, 
perhaps driven by automatic reloads, along with a 
higher middle region, perhaps due to users checking for 
latest news.
Grouping
We consider each revisitation curve to be a signature of 
user behavior in accessing a given Web page. Given our 
representation of behavior it is natural to ask about the 
range of different curves. In order to group these curves we 
apply a clustering algorithm to the 55,000 curves to group 
those that have similar shape and magnitude. Specifically, 
we use repeated-bisection clustering [12] with a cosine 
similarity metric and the ratio of intra- to extra- cluster 
similarity as the objective function. In practice we find that 
clusters are fairly stable regardless of the specific clustering 
or similarity metric. By varying the number of clusters and 
testing within- and between-cluster similarity we find that 
the objective function levels off at around 12 clusters
(graphically represented in Table 3 and Figure 3), which we 
use in the analyses below.
As shown in Table 3, we further ordered, named, and 
manually grouped the clusters based on general trends into 
four groups: fast, medium, slow, and hybrid. Many 
revisitation patterns fell at the extremes. Five clusters 
represented primarily fast revisitation patterns, where 
people revisited the member Web pages many times over a 
short interval but rarely revisited over longer intervals. On 
the other hand, four clusters represented slow revisitation 
patterns, with people revisiting the member pages mostly at 
intervals of a week or more. Between these two extremes 
are two groups of clusters. One is a hybrid combination of 
fast and slow revisitations, and displays a bimodal 
revisitation pattern. The other type consists of two medium 
clusters comprised of URLs that are revisited primarily at 
intervals between an hour and a day. The clusters in this 
group are less peaked and show more variability in 
revisitation intervals than the fast or slow groups.
The self-reported revisitation reinforces the selection of our 
grouping criteria as patterns from the surveys were fairly 
consistent, not only with the participant’s observed page 
interactions, but with patterns in the aggregate log data. 
Participants tended to report hourly or daily visits to pages 
that were clustered as fast or medium-term revisitation, and 
weekly, monthly or longer revisits those pages with slow 
revisitation patterns. The self-reported regularity of access 
decreased as the visitation interval increased. Participants 
reported visiting early and medium pages at regular 
intervals, and slow pages at irregular intervals.
In our discussion of the clusters, we focus primarily on 
large trends between these groups of clusters. Where 
appropriate, we also discuss details of the specific clusters.
