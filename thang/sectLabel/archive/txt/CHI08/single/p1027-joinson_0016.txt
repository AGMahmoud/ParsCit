The third factor is related to the posting and viewing of 
photographs (see Table 4), although many of the items also 
had loadings in the .3 region on the first factor. This 
suggests that these activities within Facebook may fulfill a 
number of gratifications. Specifically, the social uses of 
photographs (e.g. sharing, tagging) may also play an 
important role in ‘social connection’. However, by forming 
a unique factor, they may also be a content gratification in 
their own right.
Factor 3: Photographs (Cronbach’s alpha =.89)	Item Mean (SD)	Loading
Viewing photos	5.03 (1.72)	.609
Being tagged in photos	4.24 (1.90)	.668
Tagging photos	3.96 (1.89)	.734
Sharing / posting photographs	4.58 (1.89)	.701
Table 4: Items and loading (Factor 3)
Factor four contains items related to content within 
Facebook – for instance, applications and quizzes (see 
Table 5). This relates to the usual ‘content gratification’ 
identified in previous media research. It is worthwhile 
noting that while these items form a unique factor, the mean 
scores are relatively low. A single item (‘Looking at posted 
items’) loaded on the factor, but did not meet factor purity 
criteria.
Factor 4: Content (Cronbach’s alpha = .74)	Item Mean (SD)	Loading
Applications within Facebook	2.85 (1.65)	.826
Playing games	1.86 (1.40)	.559
Discovering apps because you see friends have added them	2.64 (1.58)	.756
Quizzes	1.85 1.30)	.638
Table 5: Items and loading (Factor 4)
Factor five contains items akin to both social searching and 
social browsing identified by Lampe et al [16]. The items 
comprising this factor cover both the use of Facebook to 
meet or view new people and to find out more about people 
who are met offline (see Table 6).
Factor 5: Social investigation (Cronbach’s alpha =.75)	Item Mean (SD)	Loading
Virtual people watching	3.31 (1.90)	.574
Using advanced search to look for specific types of people	2.56 (1.70)	.508
Meeting new people	2.91 (1.83)	.509
Stalking other people	2.13 (1.71)	.755
Table 6: Items and loading (Factor 5)
One item (‘Looking up the profile of people you meet 
offline’) loaded on the factor but did not meet the purity 
criteria. The items do share a targeted investigation of 
others, however. As such, the factor is termed ‘social 
investigation’.
Factor six comprises items related to a unique affordance of 
social networking sites – the ability to view other people’s 
social networks and friends (see Table 7). This ability to 
find out more about one’s acquaintances through their 
social networks forms another important surveillance 
function, and may also be a method for increasing the size 
of one’s own social network. This specific use is termed 
‘Social network surfing’ here to signify the ability of users 
to move from one person to another via friend links, 
although it may also relate closely to a ‘process 
gratification’.
Factor 6: Social network surfing (Cronbach’s alpha =.79)	Item Mean (SD)	Loading
Looking at the profiles of people you don’t know	2.48 (1.53)	.719
Viewing other people’s friends	3.34 (1.74)	.785
Browsing your friends’ friends	3.89 (1.65)	.724
Table 7: Items and loading (Factor 6)
The final factor comprises items related to the newsfeed 
and status updates within Facebook. The newsfeed provides 
updates on both ‘friends’ status, alongside recent activity 
(e.g. the addition or removal of applications, changes in 
relationship status, addition of ‘friends’). Given the outcry 
when the newsfeed was introduced [2], the relative high 
scores for this use suggest an increasing degree of 
acceptance. Interestingly, a gratification (‘to keep up with 
the latest gossip’) also loaded on this factor (although only 
at the .4 level), suggesting a clear motivation for viewing 
the newsfeed.
Factor 7: Status updates (Cronbach’s alpha = .71)	Item Mean (SD)	Loading
Updating your own status	3.85 (1.77)	.568
The news feed	3.79 (1.83)	.531
Seeing what people have put as their status	3.84 (1.79)	.698
Table 8: Items and loading (Factor 7)
The pattern of loadings and internal reliability (Cronbach 
alpha scores) suggests that the seven factors should be 
considered suitable for use in further analysis, on the 
assumption that they are interpretable. Scales were 
developed for each factor by creating the mean score across 
the marker items.
