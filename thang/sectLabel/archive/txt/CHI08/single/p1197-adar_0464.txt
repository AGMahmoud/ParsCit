engine. The URLs are also longer in the slow group than 
the medium group, which suggests that direct access typing 
the URL was less likely for these pages.
Child-oriented content: Interestingly, many pages for 
children’s Web sites are over-represented in the slow group. 
This includes pages for the Cartoon Network 
(www.cartoonnetwork.com), the Barbie Web site 
(barbie.everythinggirl.com), Nickelodeon (www.nick.com) 
and Disney (disney.go.com). This finding may be due to 
limited availability of Internet access for children who may 
only have access at certain times of the day or days of the 
week. Additionally, many Web sites are tied to TV 
programs which have weekly periodicities. Children’s Web 
sites also display hybrid behavior which appears to be due 
to multiple functions of the Web site, which we describe in 
more detail in the next section.
Software updates: Our survey data also revealed pages in 
the slow group were used to download software updates. 
For examples, pages with “update” in the URL or content 
included application update sites such as Microsoft 
Windows Update and McAfee Update.
Hybrid Group �\,-f
URLs in the hybrid group bore similarities to several other 
groups, as can be seen in Table 4. Much of the navigation 
behavior was similar to what was observed for the fast 
group (e.g., hub-and-spoke), but the hybrid pages appeared 
to be of higher quality and receive more long-term 
revisitations. Like the medium group, hybrid pages had 
short URLs and a large number of unique visitors (274).
Popular, but infrequently used, site homepages: It is 
interesting that the most popular Web pages, in terms of 
unique visitors, fall into two different behavior patterns— 
medium and hybrid groups. Whereas the pages occurring in 
medium group indicate a fairly constant need, hybrid 
interactions reflect a rarer need that nonetheless requires 
many page revisits for the individual need to be met. For 
example, a page such as Automart’s homepage 
(www.automart.com) provides a front end interface to 
search for new sales listings, in this case for cars. A user 
may visit the page, search for updated or new listings and 
check many listings in any given visit. The homepages for 
various classifieds listing service, such as local Craig’s List 
homepages, fall into this group as well. Both hybrid and 
medium group’s pages display a higher than expected 
number of “login[s]” in the text indicating both types are 
transactional or personalized in some way.
According to the survey participants, the amount of 
meaningful change they expected to the page decreased as 
the revisitation interval increased. Visits to hybrid pages 
were particularly likely to be to find new information (on a 
page that had previously been visited). Hybrid pages also 
displayed the greatest number of changes in content. A 
hybrid behavior might be a mechanism for “catching-up” 
with changed content. Pages in the medium group
displayed the second highest number of changes and 
indicate a potentially more regular monitoring activity.
Entertainment &amp; Hobbies: Hybrid behavior is likely 
observed in situations when an activity requires hub-and-
spoke movement around the page, but the activity itself is 
somewhat infrequent. For example certain shopping related 
pages such as shopping carts exist in this group. High-level 
auction pages are also in this group (e.g. 
computers.ebay.com, home.ebay.com, etc.). The difference 
between auction related pages, such as eBay, and other 
shopping destinations might be the requirement of 
monitoring ever-changing auctions, successive bids, and 
long-term interest in collectibles.
Another over-represented category within the hybrid group 
are “games” pages (as indicated by the page text and by the 
page categories). It is interesting —though perhaps 
unsurprising—that games are played rarely but repeatedly.
Combined Fast &amp; Slow: Unlike the medium group, the 
hybrid group received significantly fewer mean visits per 
visitor (4.9 v. 7.4). This is consistent with the observation 
that most URLs in the medium group are attached to 
constant, more generic, information needs (e.g. 
communication, news, etc.) whereas page in the hybrid 
group represent more easily satisfied needs (e.g. games, 
music, or product purchase) and are more likely a 
combination of slow (rare information need) and fast (high 
“session” revisits) .
Web Sites Across Groups
Because of large scale sampling of URL data we are able to 
also look at how pages within a Web site are distributed 
across groups. This analysis generates confirmation of the 
findings described above.
As mentioned earlier, there is an over-representation of 
URLs for shopping and reference Web sites in the fast 
group (e.g., Craigslist’s pages from Seattle and New York, 
seattle.craigslist.com and newyork.craigslist.com, Ikea at 
www.ikea.com, Kelly’s Blue Book, for pricing used cars, 
www.kbb.com, and Wikipedia at www.wikipedia.org). An 
interesting characteristic of such sites is that while a vast 
majority of the pages inside the website were in the fast 
group, their top-level homepages (e.g., 
http://www.ikea.com/ and http://www.wikipedia.org/) fell 
into the slow group. The homepage visits probably 
represent the occasional need people have for the type of 
information (Ikea furniture, encyclopedic references, or 
used car pricing), while the deeper pages that fall in the fast 
group probably represent individual’s behavior when 
satisfying the need. This suggests that while some Web 
pages themselves may fall into fast or slow groups, the Web 
sites may display hybrid or slow behavior.
In general, we find that Web sites that serve a single 
consistent role tend to be present in only one group. For 
example, BlinkYou, a predominantly fast site at 
www.blinkyou.com, provides widgets to embed in 
MySpace homepages and MSN Weather, a generally slow
