Figure 5c illustrates mean first page gaze duration. 
Participants’ mean gaze duration in the first page was 
longer in the high density (M = 407 ms) than low density 
layout (M = 387.259 ms), F(1,23) = 22.414, p &lt; 0.001. The 
main effect of number of pages was not significant. There 
was no interaction between density and number of pages.
Figure 5d shows the data of mean proportion of first page 
skipping gaze transitions. The density had significant effect, 
F (1, 23) = 46.72, p &lt; 0.001. It was found that that 
participants were more likely to skip thumbnails in the high 
density (M = 72%) than in the low density layout (M = 
67.2%). The main effect of number of pages was also 
significant, F (2, 46) = 15.00, p &lt; 0.001. Every pairwise 
comparison of number of pages condition was significantly 
different (p &lt; 0.01). It showed that our participants skipped 
more often in 5-pages condition (M = 66.5%), than they did 
in 2-pages condition (M = 70.3%), which in turn was more 
often than in the 1-page condition (M = 71.8%). There was 
no interaction between density and number of pages.

(a)
Every pair comparison of number of pages condition with 
Bonferroni method was significantly different (p &lt; 0.01). It 
was found that time spent in the first page was more in the 
fewer page condition (1-page: M = 7514.54 ms, 2-pages: M 
= 6117.07 ms and 5-pages: M = 5606.10 ms). The 
interaction between density and number of pages was not 
significant. Results are summarized in Figure 5a.
Figure 5b shows the data of mean number of gazes in the 
first page. Number of gazes was approximate one fewer in 
the high density (M = 8.16) than low density (M = 9.29), 
F(1,23) = 24.65, p &lt; 0.001. There was also a main effect of 
number of pages, F(2,46) = 24.9, p &lt; 0.001. Every pair 
comparison of number of pages condition with Bonferroni 
method was significantly different (p &lt; 0.001). It showed 
that participants spent greater number of gazes in fewer 
page conditions (1-page: M = 10.96, 2-pages: M = 8.07 and 
5-pages condition: M = 7.11). In addition, the interaction of 
density and number of pages was also significant, F(2,46) = 
4.48, p = 0.017. The fewest number of gazes were made in 
the first page of the high density display when there were 5- 
pages of items.
