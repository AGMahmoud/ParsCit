solution rate). Thus our findings suggest that asynchronous 
teams would benefit from the use of such tools to solve 
complex problems.
Design Implication
This study has just one main implication for designing tools 
for complex problem solving—that is, create a visualization 
tool. Our study also suggests that, for most effective 
collaboration, visualization tools should have the capability 
of being jointly manipulated and should facilitate the 
integration of data from different collaborators.
CONCLUSION
Information visualization in the form of a network diagram 
aided both individual and collaborative complex problem 
solving. Real collaboration improved the performance of 
pairs over statistical pairings, particularly if pairs (a) had an 
integrated visualization that both could manipulate, and (b) 
when pairs discussed the visualizations they received. 
Doing so led to more relevant discussion of evidence and 
higher solution rates.
