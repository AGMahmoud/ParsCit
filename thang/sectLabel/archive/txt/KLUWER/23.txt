Abstract. In this paper, we introduce a unified approach for the adaptive control of 3G mobile networks in order to improve both quality +L+ of service (QoS) for mobile subscribers and to increase revenue for service providers. The introduced approach constantly monitors QoS +L+ measures as packet loss probability and the current number of active mobile users during operation of the network. Based on the values +L+ of the QoS measures just observed, the system parameters of the admission controller and packet scheduler are controlled by the adaptive +L+ performance management entity. Considering UMTS, we present performance curves showing that handover failure probability is improved +L+ by more than one order of magnitude. Moreover, the packet loss probability can be effectively regulated to a predefined level and provider +L+ revenue is significantly increased for all pricing policies.

1. Introduction
The third generation (3G) of mobile networks is expected +L+ to complete the worldwide globalization process of mobile +L+ communication. Since different parts of the worlds empha- +L+ size different issues, the global term 3G has regional syn- +L+ onyms: In the US and Japan, 3G often carries the name In- +L+ ternational Mobile Telephony 2000 (IMT2000). In Europe, +L+ 3G has become Universal Mobile Telecommunications Sys- +L+ tem (UMTS) following the ETSI perspective. The European +L+ industrial players have created the 3rd Generation Partner- +L+ ship Project (3GPP) [1] for the standardization of UMTS. +L+ 3G mobile networks provide the foundation for new services +L+ with high-rate data not provided by current second generation +L+ systems [26]. While the standardization of 3G is still ongo- +L+ ing the discussion of technical issues beyond 3G has already +L+ started [23,28]. Recently, Aretz et al. reported a vision for +L+ the future of wireless communication systems beyond 3G that +L+ consists of a combination of several optimized access systems +L+ on a common IP-based medium access and core network plat- +L+ form [5].
Charging and pricing are essential issues for network op- +L+ erations of 3G mobile networks. A primary target of differen- +L+ tiated pricing of Internet services is the prevention of system +L+ overload and an optimal resource usage according to differ- +L+ ent daytimes and different traffic intensities [12]. Among the +L+ proposed pricing proposals, flat-rate pricing [11] is the most +L+ common mode of payment today for bandwidth services. +L+ Flat-rate pricing is popular because of its minimal account- +L+ ing overhead. A flat-rate encourages usage but does not offer +L+ any motivation for users to adjust their demand. Dynamic +L+ pricing models that take the state of the network into account +L+ in the price determination have been proposed as being more

responsive. Usage-based pricing regulates usage by impos- +L+ ing a fee based on the amount of data actually sent, whereas +L+ congestion-sensitive pricing uses a fee based on the current +L+ state of congestion in the network. Thus, a unified approach +L+ considering both dynamic pricing and controlling quality of +L+ service (i.e., performance management) provides an effective +L+ tool for the operation of 3G mobile networks. However, in +L+ previous work [8,13,19,21,25] the improvement of Quality of +L+ Service (QoS) in 3G mobile networks and the optimization +L+ of mobile service provider revenue has been considered sepa- +L+ rately.
The Quality of Service (QoS) concept and architecture for +L+ UMTS networks specified in [2] provides means for shar- +L+ ing radio resources among different groups of users accord- +L+ ing to their individual QoS demands. Furthermore, the con- +L+ cept of UMTS management and control functions such as +L+ admission controller and resource manager is roughly out- +L+ lined. Das et al. proposed a framework for QoS provisioning +L+ for multimedia services in 3G wireless access networks [8]. +L+ They developed an integrated framework by combining var- +L+ ious approaches for call admission control, channel reser- +L+ vation, bandwidth degradation, and bandwidth compaction. +L+ In [19], we introduced a framework for the adaptive control +L+ of UMTS networks, which utilizes online monitoring of QoS +L+ measures (e.g., handover failure and call blocking probabil- +L+ ities) in order to adjust system parameters of the admission +L+ controller and the packet scheduler. The presented approach +L+ is based on a lookup table called the Performance Manage- +L+ ment Information Base (P-MIB). Entries of the P-MIB have +L+ to be determined using extensive off-line simulation experi- +L+ ments to determine optimal parameter configuration for the +L+ considered scenarios. Given the entries of the P-MIB, we +L+ showed how to improve QoS for mobile users by periodi- +L+ cally adjusting system parameters. The practical applicability +L+ of this approach is limited if the P-MIB comprises many en-

tries (i.e., many scenarios have to be considered) because of +L+ the high computational effort for determining these entries by +L+ simulation.
This paper introduces a unified approach for the adaptive +L+ performance management for 3G mobile networks. As the +L+ main result of the paper, the introduced approach is based on +L+ a mathematical framework for the proposed update schemes +L+ rather than a lookup table. As a consequence, the adaptive +L+ control mechanism can be adjusted in an intuitive way and +L+ optimal system parameter configuration can efficiently be de- +L+ termined. We effectively utilize adaptive performance man- +L+ agement for improving not only QoS for mobile users but +L+ also increase revenue earned by service providers. As in [19], +L+ controlled system parameters comprise queueing weights for +L+ packet scheduling, a threshold value of the access queue for +L+ admission of non real-time traffic, and a portion of the over- +L+ all available bandwidth reserved for handover calls. Be- +L+ yond [19], we propose a scheme for adjusting the queueing +L+ weights for both improving QoS for higher priority users that +L+ suffer from a high population of users with lower priority and +L+ for increasing the revenue earned by the service provider. For +L+ the analysis of the update strategy of the queuing weights, we +L+ consider a usage-based and a usage-/throughput-based pric- +L+ ing policy according to [11,12,21]. Furthermore, we intro- +L+ duce a hybrid pricing policy combining the notion of flat- +L+ rate and a usage-based pricing according to current policies +L+ of GSM networks. Performance curves derived by simulation +L+ evidently illustrate the gain of the unified approach for adap- +L+ tive performance management. In fact, for UMTS networks, +L+ simulation results show that handover failure probability can +L+ be improved by more than one order of magnitude. Moreover, +L+ packet loss probability can be effectively regulated to a prede- +L+ fined level and the provider revenue is significantly increased +L+ for all considered pricing policies.
The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 introduces the +L+ unified approach for adaptive performance management and +L+ describes its embedding in the system architecture of 3G mo- +L+ bile networks. Section 3 introduces strategies for controlling +L+ the parameters of an admission controller in order to improve +L+ QoS. Section 4 describes the parameter control of a packet +L+ scheduler for the combined improvement of both QoS and +L+ provider revenue. In section 5, we present simulation results +L+ that illustrate the benefit of employing the proposed approach +L+ for adaptive performance management. Finally, concluding +L+ remarks are given.
2. Adaptive performance management for 3G mobile +L+ networks
2.1. Description of the unified approach
This section introduces the unified approach for regularly ad- +L+ justing system parameters to changing traffic load, packet ar- +L+ rival pattern or population of users, etc. We consider a cellular +L+ mobile network in which a different transceiver station serves +L+ each cell. The purpose of the transceiver station is the modu-

lation of carrier frequencies and demodulation of signals. Fur- +L+ thermore, a base station controller (BSC) is considered that is +L+ responsible for a cluster of cells, i.e., several transceiver sta- +L+ tions. The BSC manages the radio resources, i.e., schedules +L+ data packets, and controls handovers inside the cell cluster as +L+ well as handovers towards and from neighboring cell clusters.
To improve QoS for mobile users as well as to increase +L+ revenue earned by service providers, an entity for Adaptive +L+ Performance Management (APM) is included in a BSC. Fur- +L+ thermore, a BSC has to be extended by an online performance +L+ monitoring component that derives QoS measures in a cer- +L+ tain time window (e.g., handover failure probabilities of mo- +L+ bile users or packet loss probabilities). These QoS measures +L+ form a system pattern that is submitted in fixed time intervals +L+ (i.e., a control period) to the APM entity, which subsequently +L+ updates corresponding system parameters (i.e., parameters of +L+ traffic controlling components like the admission controller +L+ and packet scheduler). Thus, the proposed approach closes +L+ the loop between network operation and network control. Fig- +L+ ure 1 shows the system architecture for performance manage- +L+ ment embedded in a BSC.
2.1.1. Online performance monitoring
System parameters of a BSC can be effectively updated by +L+ monitoring QoS measures, which are immediately affected by +L+ these parameters. A current value for a QoS measure is deter- +L+ mined online based on a set of relevant events corresponding +L+ to this QoS measure (e.g., packet arrivals are relevant events +L+ for computing packet loss probabilities). The online monitor- +L+ ing of QoS measures is done by a sliding window technique +L+ as introduced in [19]. The width of the sliding window over +L+ time depends on the number of relevant events that are oc- +L+ curred according to a QoS measure. Upon arrival of a new +L+ relevant event the sliding window moves in time. At the end +L+ of a control period the QoS measures are derived for each +L+ sliding window (e.g., packet loss probability can be derived +L+ from number of lost packets divided by number of all packet +L+ arrivals in the sliding window). These QoS measures and the +L+ number of events occurred in the last control period form the +L+ system pattern that is transferred to the adaptive performance +L+ management entity (see figure 1).
IMPROVING QoS AND PROVIDER REVENUE IN 3G MOBILE NETWORKS	211
Note that an accurate online monitoring of QoS measures +L+ requires a specific width for the sliding window. A certain +L+ number of events representing the history of the QoS mea- +L+ sure have to be considered to get an expressive measure. On +L+ the other hand considering a big sliding window prevents the +L+ APM entity from fast reaction on changing traffic conditions. +L+ A bigger sliding window contains more history and, thus, +L+ more events have to be collected to cause a significant change +L+ in the online monitored QoS measure. This tradeoff between +L+ accurate online monitoring and fast reaction of the APM to +L+ changing traffic conditions has to be studied carefully in sev- +L+ eral experiments to get the optimal width of the sliding win- +L+ dow for each QoS measure.
2.1.2. Adaptive performance management
Whenever a system pattern S = { (P1, n 1) , ... , (Pm, nm )}, +L+ consisting of online monitored QoS measures P1, ... , Pm +L+ and the numbers of relevant events n1, ... , nm occurred in +L+ the last control period is transmitted to the APM an up- +L+ date of the system parameters can be performed. In gen- +L+ eral, an update of a system parameter σ is made according +L+ to a function f depending on a subset of the QoS measures +L+ P1, ... , Pm and the previous value σ(old) of the system pa- +L+ rameter. Let Pτ(1), ... , Pτ(k), k S m, be the QoS measures +L+ corresponding to system parameter σ, then the update is made +L+ if a certain minimum number n(σ) of relevant events occurred +L+ in the last control period. That is:
σ(new) = f (Pτ (1), ... , Pτ(k), σ
if min{nτ(1), ... , nτ(k)} n(σ).11 (1)
We classify update functions in relative functions, that per- +L+ form a parameter update relative to the old parameter value +L+ and absolute functions that set the new parameter value in- +L+ dependent of the old value, i.e., f is independent of σ(old) +L+ in (1). With relative update functions strong fluctuations of +L+ the corresponding system parameter in one update step can be +L+ avoided. In section 3, we study a special class of relative up- +L+ date functions in order to set the parameters of an admission +L+ controller. Furthermore, we develop in section 4 an absolute +L+ update function for adjusting the weights of a weighted fair +L+ queueing packet scheduler.
2.2. Economics and pricing policies in 3G mobile networks
There are multiple requirements, which should be fulfilled +L+ for any viable pricing mechanism in multi-service class data +L+ communication networks [12]. A primary target of differen- +L+ tiated pricing of Internet services is the prevention of system +L+ overload and an optimal resource usage according to differ- +L+ ent daytimes and different traffic intensities. Furthermore, the +L+ pricing scheme should be implemented in a completely de- +L+ centralized manner and there should be multiple priorities in +L+ order to take into account the different QoS required by dif- +L+ ferent applications and users.
In general, pricing policies can be partitioned into usage- +L+ based (pay-as-you-go) pricing, flat-rate (all-you-can-eat) +L+ pricing, and dynamic pricing. In usage-based pricing poli- +L+ cies a user is charged according to a connection time or traffic +L+ volume. Whereas connection based calls (e.g., in GSM) are +L+ charged by connection time, packet-switched services (e.g., in +L+ UMTS) are charging the transferred data volume. Dynamic +L+ pricing models take into account the state of the mobile ra- +L+ dio network for determining the current price of a service. +L+ Congestion-sensitive pricing as a particular dynamic pricing +L+ model has been shown to be more responsive. MacKie-Mason +L+ and Varian introduced the concept of congestion-sensitive +L+ pricing in their smart market scheme [21]. Under this model, +L+ the actual price for each packet is determined based on the +L+ current state of network congestion. In [25], Rao and Petersen +L+ discussed the optimal pricing of priority services. Analo- +L+ gously to the smart market approach, Gupta et al. presented +L+ a pricing scheme that uses priorities on the packet-level [13]. +L+ They proposed to differentiate Internet traffic according to de- +L+ lay and loss requirements.
For the analysis of the update strategy of the queuing +L+ weights, we consider in section 4 a usage-based and a usage-/ +L+ throughput-based pricing policy according to [11,12,21]. Fur- +L+ thermore, we introduce a hybrid pricing policy combining the +L+ notion of flat-rate and a usage-based pricing according to cur- +L+ rent policies of GSM networks.
3. Strategies for improving Quality of Service +L+ 3.1. Admission controller
The proposed approach distinguishes three different types +L+ of services: circuit-switched services, packet-switched real- +L+ time services (RT), and packet-switched non real-time ser- +L+ vices (NRT). Typically, circuit-switched services are voice +L+ calls from a GSM mobile station. As proposed by 3GPP, RT +L+ services belong to the conversational and streaming classes +L+ and NRT services fall into the interactive and background +L+ classes [2]. The bandwidth available in a cell must be shared +L+ by calls of these different service classes and the different ser- +L+ vice requirements have to be met. Before a mobile session +L+ begins, the user needs to specify its traffic characteristics and +L+ desired performance requirements by a QoS profile. Then, an +L+ admission controller decides to accept or reject the users re- +L+ quest based on the QoS profile and the current network state +L+ as, e.g., given by queueing length. The purpose of the admis- +L+ sion controller is to guarantee the QoS requirements of the +L+ user who requested admission while not violating the QoS +L+ profiles of already admitted users. The call admission criteria +L+ will be different for each service class. The QoS profile for +L+ RT sessions specifies a guaranteed bandwidth to be provided +L+ for the application in order to meet its QoS requirements. If +L+ the network cannot satisfy the desired bandwidth, the corre- +L+ sponding admission request is rejected.
Data packets arriving at the BSC are queued until they are +L+ scheduled to be transmitted over the radio link. For NRT ses- +L+ sions, we consider an admission controller taking into account +L+ free buffer space in the NRT queue [8]. In order to prevent +L+ buffer overflow once a call is admitted, the current queue- +L+ ing length is set against certain buffer availability threshold
212	C. LINDEMANN ET AL.
of the capacity, denoted by η. The admission criteria for +L+ voice and RT handovers are the same as for new voice calls +L+ and RT sessions except that additional handover bandwidth +L+ can be utilized. The analysis of several admission control +L+ schemes for cellular systems presented in [24] showed that +L+ the simple reservation scheme (i.e., reserving bandwidth for +L+ handover calls) performs remarkably well. For simple cellu- +L+ lar networks, the optimal amount of bandwidth reserved for +L+ handover calls can be determined by analytical models [14]. +L+ In the model presented here, we denote with bh the portion +L+ of the overall bandwidth that is exclusively reserved for han- +L+ dover calls from neighboring cells. The considered admission +L+ controller does not prioritize NRT handovers over new NRT +L+ sessions. Further details of the admission controller are given +L+ in [19].
3.2. Adjusting the admission controllerfor QoS improvement
In this section, we show how to utilize equation (1) for setting +L+ the parameters η and bh of the admission controller in order to +L+ reduce packet loss probability and handover failure probabil- +L+ ity. For updating the system parameters, we split the general +L+ function introduced in section 2.1 into separate functions each +L+ depending only on one QoS measure. Let P1, ... , Pk be the +L+ QoS measures corresponding to a system parameter σ. Then, +L+ equation (1) can be simplified to
σ(new) = f1 (P1) + ··· + fk(Pk) σ (old)
k
L\σ(new)\R. (2)
The interpretation of (2) is the following. Each update +L+ function fi describes the influence that the QoS measure +L+ Pi should have on the system parameter σ. Subsequently, +L+ the overall update is performed by computing the arithmetic +L+ mean of the functions fi multiplied with the old value of the +L+ system parameter. Note that the value σ(new) must be trun- +L+ cated at a certain lower bound L and an upper bound R in +L+ order to guarantee that the computation of σ(new) results in a +L+ valid value of the system parameter. As basic update function +L+ we consider a logarithmic linear function of the form:
fi (Pi) = mi log Pi + bi. (3)
The reason for this choice is that we want to consider QoS +L+ measures like loss probabilities and failure/blocking proba- +L+ bilities, which are in the range of 10−5 to 1. Therefore, a +L+ logarithmic shape is more suitable. In previous work [19], +L+ we have studied update schemes of system parameters of +L+ an admission controller and a packet scheduler based on a +L+ lookup table. In order to determine the optimal entries of this +L+ lookup table extensive off-line simulation experiments have +L+ been conducted. Applying regression statistics to the entries +L+ of this lookup table shows that these entries are well repre- +L+ sented by functions with logarithmic shape. Thus, besides the +L+ motivation of the update functions given here, their choice +L+ is to a large extend originated from regression statistics con- +L+ ducted in earlier work. The strength of the influence of fi on +L+ σ(new) can be adjusted with the gradient mi. The parameter bi +L+ can be determined by the following interpretation: suppose +L+ the desired level of the QoS measure Pi is βi (e.g., the de- +L+ sired packet loss probability is 0.001). That is, if the online +L+ measured value of Pi is βi the system parameter σ should +L+ not be changed in the update step from the point of view of +L+ measure Pi. Therefore, we chose fi (βi) = 1 and from this +L+ relation we get bi = 1 − mi log βi. Inserting in equation (3) +L+ results in the final form of the update function:
.fi (Pi) = mi log Pi + 1.	(4)
βi
For ease of notation, we abbreviate the QoS measures han- +L+ dover failure probability and new call/session blocking prob- +L+ ability corresponding to voice calls and RT sessions by HFP +L+ and CBP, respectively. The probability of a packet loss due +L+ to buffer overflow in the NRT queue is abbreviated by PLP. +L+ The update strategy according to equations (2)–(4) is justified +L+ by its intuitive understanding and the performance results pre- +L+ sented in section 5. The suitability of update functions other +L+ than (2)–(4), is subject for further study and out of the scope +L+ of this paper.
3.2.1. Update of non real-time queue threshold
Recall that a system parameter update is performed each time +L+ a system pattern arrives at the APM entity and the minimum +L+ number of relevant events corresponding to this system para- +L+ meter is reached. Determining the update for the system para- +L+ meter η, i.e., determining η(new), is performed corresponding +L+ to the old value η(old) and the actually observed QoS measure +L+ PLP. That is:
η(new) = f (PLP) · η(old), 0.001 \ η(new) \ 1.	(5)
The truncation of η(new) at the lower bound guaranties that +L+ the value does not accumulate near zero for long periods of +L+ low traffic load. The minimum number of relevant events re- +L+ quired for an update of η is counted in data volume rather than +L+ in packet arrivals (in the experiments this number is 5 MB). +L+ The setting of the gradient m of the corresponding update +L+ function is derived from a couple of experiments for different +L+ values of the gradient. We found m = −0.02 to be suitable. +L+ Choosing a suitable value for the gradient is a similar tradeoff +L+ as explained for the sliding window size. A large gradient re- +L+ sults in a fast update of the system parameter in a few number +L+ of update steps, but also introduces higher fluctuations of the +L+ system parameter over time. We demonstrate the speed of the +L+ parameter adjustment in an experiment in section 5. Further- +L+ more, several experiments for different desired loss values β +L+ are presented.
3.2.2. Update offraction of bandwidth reserved for handover +L+ The update for the system parameter bh, i.e., determining
b(new)
h, is performed based on the old value and the actually +L+ observed QoS measures HFP and CBP. That is:
b(new)	h= f1(HFP) +2 f2(CBP) ·b(old)
h	,
0.001 \ b(new)	h\ R.	(6)
IMPROVING QoS AND PROVIDER REVENUE IN 3G MOBILE NETWORKS	213
The value b(hnew) is truncated at a lower bound of 0.1% +L+ and a certain upper bound R which is a fraction of the over- +L+ all bandwidth available (in the experiments we fix R = 0.7). +L+ The truncation at the lower bound is for the same reason as +L+ explained above. In fact, for computing b(hnew) two QoS mea- +L+ sures corresponding to the actually observed HFP and CBP +L+ are taken into account. A high HFP should increase bhnew) +L+ but this obviously also increases the CBP because less band- +L+ width is available for new voice calls and RT sessions. There- +L+ fore, the HFP and the CBP influence the handover bandwidth +L+ b(hnew). In fact, m1 = −m2 holds in the update functions f1 +L+ and f2. From a couple of experiments for different gradients, +L+ we found m1 = 0.08 to be suitable. A common assumption +L+ in cellular networks is to prioritize handover calls over new +L+ calls. Therefore, the desired handover failure level β1 should +L+ be smaller than the desired call blocking level β2. According +L+ to these values the handover bandwidth is slightly increased, +L+ if HFP is equal to CBP.
With the presented strategy the parameters of the update +L+ functions can be chosen in an intuitive way and optimal para- +L+ meter configuration can efficiently be determined. This is the +L+ major advantage over the approach based on a Performance +L+ Management Information Base introduced in [19] which re- +L+ quires extensive off-line simulation experiments.
4. Strategies for improving both QoS and provider +L+ revenue
4.1. Packet scheduler
At a BSC responsible for a cluster of cells, data packets from +L+ various connections arrive and are queued until bandwidth +L+ for transmission is available. In order to distinguish differ- +L+ ent priorities for NRT traffic corresponding to the traffic han- +L+ dling priority defined by 3GPP [2], scheduling algorithms +L+ like Weighted Round Robin (WRR), Weighted Fair Queue- +L+ ing (WFQ [9]) or Class Based Queueing (CBQ [10]) have to +L+ be implemented. An overview of queueing issues for guar- +L+ anteed performance services can be found in [27]. In WFQ, +L+ the weights control the amount of traffic a source may de- +L+ liver relative to other active sources during some period of +L+ time. From the scheduling algorithm’s point of view, a source +L+ is considered to be active, if it has data queued in the NRT +L+ queue. Let B be the overall bandwidth available for NRT +L+ sessions at time t. For an active source i with weight wi, the +L+ bandwidth Bi that is allocated to this transfer at time t is given +L+ by
Bi =	wi	 B.(7)
	Ej w j
In (7) the sum is taken over all active NRT sources j. A class +L+ based version of WFQ serves packets of each priority class +L+ according to the weights rather than every active source.
4.2. Adjusting the packet schedulerfor QoS and revenue +L+ improvement
This section utilizes the proposed approach for the adaptive +L+ control of the weights of a weighted fair queueing packet +L+ scheduler in order to improve QoS as well as to increase the +L+ revenue. The strategy for adjusting the weights combined +L+ with the introduction of several pricing policies constitutes +L+ a further contribution of the paper. Recall that the revenue +L+ earned by a mobile service provider is determined by the +L+ monthly payment of mobile users as well as by the additional +L+ usage-based pricing after the monthly amount of data volume +L+ is consumed. Note, that the monthly subscription rate is only +L+ relevant for monthly revenue calculations. In this section, we +L+ consider the revenue improvement in a certain small time pe- +L+ riod regardless the monthly subscription rates. In section 5, +L+ we briefly discuss monthly revenue calculation. Let P denote +L+ the number of different priority classes, i.e., weights of the +L+ weighted fair queueing scheduler. Define by bi (t) the trans- +L+ ferred data volume in time t of users of priority i and by ri (t) +L+ the payment of users of priority i at time t, i.e., the user pays +L+ for the transferred data volume. We distinguish a pure usage- +L+ based and a usage-/throughput-based pricing policy:
(a) A user of priority i has a fixed payment pi per kbit during +L+ his session, i.e., ri (t) = pi.
(b) The payment of a user of priority i consists of a fixed part +L+ pi that is increased proportional to the additional through- +L+ put ϕi (t) he received due to the update of the queueing +L+ weights, i.e., ri (t) = pi ϕi (t).
According to the proposed data volume based pricing with +L+ respect to different priority classes the revenue function 4) (t) +L+ is given by
4)(t) = �P ri (t)bi (t). (8)
i=1
The revenue function of equation (8) is utilized in section 5 +L+ for evaluating the strategies for revenue improvement pre- +L+ sented below.
4.2.1. Update of WFQ weights
Recall that packets of NRT users arriving at the BSC are first +L+ queued until they are scheduled for transfer by a weighted +L+ fair queueing discipline. Let wi wi+1, i = 1, ... , P − 1, +L+ be the basic weights of the WFQ scheduler. The update of +L+ the queueing weights, i.e., determining winew) is made ac- +L+ cording to an absolute update function depending on the basic +L+ weights wi and the current number of NRT sessions belong- +L+ ing to priority i. Therefore, every system pattern that is trans- +L+ mitted from the online monitoring component to the adaptive +L+ performance management entity contains the current number +L+ of active NRT sessions with priority i in the cell. For ease +L+ of notation, the number of active non real-time sessions with +L+ priority i is abbreviated by NRTi .
The idea behind the strategy for revenue improvement is +L+ to shift the overall utilization of bandwidth for NRT traffic
214	C. LINDEMANN ET AL.
towards higher priority users, which pay more for the trans- +L+ ferred data volume. Note that the update strategy should be +L+ conservative in a way that the transfer of packets of low pri- +L+ ority is not simply blocked if packets of higher priorities are +L+ arriving, i.e., priority queueing. Assuming that the majority +L+ of users will buy a cheaper low priority service class, priority +L+ queueing will leave most users unsatisfied. Therefore, the up- +L+ date strategy also considers the QoS aspect. The update strat- +L+ egy concerning the queueing weights is developed according +L+ to the following premises:
(i) If the number of active NRT users in the cell is the same +L+ for each priority class, i.e., NRTi = NRTj, i =� j, +L+ the weights wi(new) should be set according to the basic +L+ weights wi for i = 1, ... , P.
(ii) Priority classes with low population of users compared +L+ to other classes should be prioritized, i.e., the corre- +L+ sponding weights should be increased.
(iii) The relative ordering of the weights should be preserved +L+ in a strong way, i.e., winew) · (wi/wi+1) · wi+1) for i = +L+ 1,...,P−1.
Premise (i) constitutes the key of the update strategy. If all +L+ priority classes have the same population of users the schedul- +L+ ing should work as in the case without adaptive control of +L+ the weights. The rationale behind premise (ii) is to priori- +L+ tize users that are consuming less bandwidth (relative to their +L+ weights) than users belonging to other classes, i.e., users of +L+ low population should be made more independent from the +L+ influence of user classes with higher population. This premise +L+ constitutes the basic idea for QoS improvement and is demon- +L+ strated by the following example that considers two priority +L+ classes, i.e., a high and low priority class. In WFQ the avail- +L+ able bandwidth is shared among all active users according to +L+ their weights. That is, if the minority are high priority users, +L+ the overall bandwidth consumed by these users will suffer +L+ from a strong influence of low priority users that hold the +L+ majority. Therefore, increasing the weights for high priority +L+ users will result in a higher QoS for this user class. Updating +L+ the weights according to this strategy will result in a schedul- +L+ ing algorithm somewhere between a WFQ and a class based +L+ queueing scheduler. In fact, the benefit of both is utilized: the +L+ fair sharing of the bandwidth of WFQ and the higher band- +L+ width guarantees for each priority class provided by a class +L+ based queueing scheduler.
Preserving the relative ordering of the weights (i.e., +L+ premise (iii)) guarantees that QoS for higher priority users +L+ and, therefore, the provider revenue can only be improved +L+ due to the adaptive control of the weights. If the intention +L+ of the update strategy is not primary on improving provider +L+ revenue the weights can be also set in a weak relation, i.e.,

4.2.2. Considering advanced pricing policies
In pricing policy (b) introduced above, users have to pay an +L+ additional fee depending on the throughput improvement due +L+ to the update of the queueing weights. This concept of pric- +L+ ing indicates strong similarities to the congestion-sensitive +L+ pricing of the smart market scheme [21], where the actual +L+ price for each packet is determined based on the current state +L+ of network congestion. Similarly, in our throughput-based +L+ pricing policy the throughput of users is determined by their +L+ willingness-to-pay additional costs (according to their choice +L+ of priority class) for transmission of packets in a congested +L+ network. The additional payment is justified because the +L+ throughput for users of higher priority will be maintained, +L+ even if more and more users of lower priority attend the cell, +L+ i.e., the network is currently congested. We describe the rela-
In equation (11), THRi is the current throughput of class i de- +L+ rived from the corresponding sliding window and 0 &lt; γ &lt; 1 +L+ is a scaling exponent (e.g., γ = 1/4) that has to be adjusted +L+ by the service provider for appropriate revenue dimension- +L+ ing. In order to guarantee that revenue will be only improved, +L+ ϕi (t) has to be truncated, i.e., ϕi (t) &gt; 1.
Next, we adjust the weights according to an advanced pric- +L+ ing policy that adopts ideas, which have been successful in +L+ existing GSM networks. In GSM networks, the pricing of +L+ a provided service is as follows: the proposed service is of- +L+ fered based on a monthly payment for a dedicated amount
IMPROVING QoS AND PROVIDER REVENUE IN 3G MOBILE NETWORKS	215
of call time. If a user has consumed this amount of time +L+ before the end of the month, he has to pay for any further +L+ use of this service based on a time-dependent accounting. +L+ This idea can be generalized and extended towards packet- +L+ switched services in 3G networks. Analogously, a user has +L+ to pay a monthly charge for a dedicated amount of data vol- +L+ ume, which can be transferred without further pricing. After +L+ using up this monthly amount of data, the user has to pay for +L+ the desired services according to the transferred data volume +L+ (byte-based). Moreover, analogous to GSM networks a user +L+ can utilize “unused” data volume, i.e., the unused fraction of +L+ the prepaid monthly amount of data volume, in subsequent +L+ months. If the monthly amount of data is unrestricted, this +L+ pricing would become a flat-rate pricing and if there is no +L+ monthly payment, the pricing follows a usage-based policy. +L+ Thus, our pricing policy constitutes a hybrid approach of flat- +L+ rate and usage-based pricing.
The update of the queueing weights can now be extended +L+ in a way that users consuming their monthly amount of data +L+ are served with a lower priority than users currently paying for +L+ their data transfer. Therefore, we introduce a new weight w&apos;
corresponding to the not paying users. The weight w&apos; must
be sorted in the weights w1, ... , wP and the iterative update +L+ algorithm (9)–(10) can be applied to the P + 1 weights as +L+ described above. In order to distinguish not paying users +L+ with different priorities these users are served by the WFQ
scheduler with weights w1 , ... , wP relative to w&apos;. That
is, WFQ is applied to 2 · P weights, i.e., w1, ... , wP and
(w&apos;/w) · w1, ... , (w&apos;/w) · wP with w = w1 + · · · + wP.
4.3. Implementation issues
As outlined in section 2.1, the controlled system parameters +L+ for QoS and revenue improvement, i.e., η, bh, wi, ϕi, con- +L+ stitute an integral component of the proposed extension to a +L+ BSC. The adjustment of system parameters is only based on +L+ implicit information that is directly measured by the online +L+ monitoring component. Therefore, no additional signaling +L+ with other BSCs is necessary for updating system parameters. +L+ The online monitored QoS measures, i.e., PLP, HFP, CBP, +L+ NRTi , and THRi , can easily be derived and stored within +L+ the BSC (see figure 1). The PLP can directly be determined +L+ by counting the number of IP packets, which are lost due to +L+ buffer overflow in the NRT queue. HFP as well as the CBP is +L+ determined by the non-admitted handover calls and new calls +L+ in the admission controller, respectively. Admission, termina- +L+ tion, and handover of NRT calls enable the profiling of NRTi , +L+ the number of non real-time sessions with priority i. More- +L+ over, the packet scheduler allows the throughput computation +L+ of NRT users according to their individual priorities. Fur- +L+ thermore, no time consuming signaling is needed to transfer +L+ the system pattern inside the BSC because the online perfor- +L+ mance monitoring component and the performance manage- +L+ ment entity both reside in the BSC.
The question arises how call charging can be accomplished +L+ for the considered pricing policies in 3G mobile networks. +L+ For pricing policy (a), i.e., a fixed payment per kbit, call +L+ charging can easily be processed by the subscription manage- +L+ ment component of the operation subsystem (OSS) by means +L+ of the call charging mechanism using the home location reg- +L+ ister (HLR) [1]. Similarly, the hybrid pricing scheme can be +L+ realized except that the remaining amount of prepaid data vol- +L+ ume has to be stored in the HLR for charging the transferred +L+ data volume. Utilizing these existing charging mechanisms, +L+ no additionally signaling overhead arises for charging data +L+ services. The throughput-based pricing policy (pricing pol- +L+ icy (b)) just slightly changes the situation and can easily be +L+ implemented within the BSC using a local copy of the user’s +L+ HLR charging data fields. This local data minimizes signal- +L+ ing overhead of individual user charging. According to the +L+ transferred data volume and current throughput of the user’s +L+ bandwidth class, this local charging profile is continuously +L+ updated. Handovers with changing BSC of response induce +L+ the transfer of this local charging profile to the new BSC of +L+ response. Subsequently, these local data have to be updated +L+ in the HLR for individual user accounting after termination of +L+ the call. Note, that this transfer of local charging profiles can +L+ naturally be embedded in the OSS functionality.
5. Evaluation of the adaptive performance management +L+ strategies
5.1. Traffic characterization for 3G networks
For traffic modeling of RT applications we utilize the ap- +L+ proach proposed in [18], where variable bit rate video traffic +L+ is modeled in terms of time-discrete M/G/∞ input processes. +L+ This model is based on measured video streams and ef- +L+ ficiently captures the correlation structure of the consid- +L+ ered video traffic applying the time-discrete M/G/∞ input +L+ process. The generated traffic is transformed utilizing a hy- +L+ brid Gamma/Pareto numerical transformation in order to cap- +L+ ture the marginal distribution of the measured traffic stream. +L+ Subsequently, the synthetically generated traffic is broken +L+ down to IP packets of a maximum size of 1500 bytes, which +L+ are uniformly distributed within a given frame-duration of the +L+ MPEG video sequence comprising of 1/30 s. Note that this +L+ traffic model does not propose information for modeling RT +L+ session durations. Therefore, we assume session durations to +L+ be exponentially distributed (see section 5.2).
Recent recommendations for modeling NRT traffic and an- +L+ alytical traffic models for 3G mobile networks are proposed +L+ in [15,16], respectively. The traffic model is based on real +L+ measurements conducted at an Internet service provider dial- +L+ in link, which comprises comparable characteristics of future +L+ mobile networks [17], i.e., different access speeds, influence +L+ of the user behavior due to different tariff limits, as well as +L+ asymmetric up- and downlink traffic. Based on these mea- +L+ surements a NRT traffic model is conducted, applying the idea +L+ of the single user traffic model, which describes traffic charac- +L+ teristics on session-level, connection-level, i.e., application- +L+ level, and packet-level, respectively. The key insight of this +L+ modeling approach lies in an appropriate scaling procedure of

We refer to [15] +L+ for details of the NRT traffic model, especially for the para- +L+ meterization of the traffic characteristics.
5.2. The simulation environment
In order to evaluate the proposed approach for adaptive con- +L+ trol, we developed a simulation environment for a UMTS ac- +L+ cess network, i.e., a UMTS Terrestrial Radio Access Network +L+ (UTRAN [3]). The simulator considers a cell cluster com- +L+ prising of seven hexagonal cells with corresponding trans- +L+ ceiver stations (i.e., Node B elements), that are managed by +L+ a base station controller (i.e., a Radio Network Controller, +L+ RNC). We assume that a mobile user requests a new session +L+ in a cell according to a Poisson process. When a mobile user +L+ starts a new session, the session is classified as voice, RT, +L+ or NRT session, i.e., with the session the user utilizes voice, +L+ RT, or NRT services mutually exclusive. RT sessions con- +L+ sist of streaming downlink traffic corresponding to the UMTS +L+ streaming class specified by 3GPP [2] and NRT sessions con- +L+ sist of elastic traffic and correspond to the UMTS interactive +L+ class or background class, respectively. For the year 2010 +L+ an amount of about 50% voice calls is anticipated [26]. We +L+ assume that one half of the voice calls are served over the fre- +L+ quency spectrum for traditional GSM services (i.e., 890–915 +L+ and 935–960 MHz) and the second half is served over the new +L+ frequency spectrum allocated for UMTS. Nevertheless, the +L+ simulator considers only the new frequency spectrum. There- +L+ fore, we assume that 25% of the call requests are voice calls +L+ whereas RT and NRT sessions constitute 15% and 60% of the +L+ overall arriving requests (see table 1).
Subsequently, we have to specify the QoS profile for RT +L+ and NRT sessions. For RT sessions the simulator considers +L+ two QoS profiles, i.e., a low bandwidth profile comprising of +L+ a guaranteed bit rate of 64 kbps corresponding to streaming +L+ audio and a high bandwidth profile comprising of a guaran- +L+ teed bit rate of 192 kbps corresponding to streaming video. +L+ According to the RT traffic model presented in section 5. 1, we +L+ assume that 80% of the RT sessions utilize the low bandwidth +L+ profile whereas the remaining 20% utilize the high bandwidth +L+ profile. Following the single user traffic model, NRT ses- +L+ sions are partitioned according to different bandwidth classes +L+ as follows: 60% for 64 kbps, 30% for 144 kbps, and 10% +L+ for 384 kbps, comprising of different priorities (see table 1), +L+ respectively.
The amount of time that a mobile user with an ongoing +L+ session remains within the cell is called dwell time. If the ses- +L+ sion is still active after the dwell time, a handover toward an +L+ adjacent cell takes place. The call/session duration is defined +L+ as the amount of time that the call will be active, assuming it +L+ completes without being forced to terminate due to handover +L+ failure. We assume the duration of voice calls and RT ses- +L+ sions to be exponentially distributed. As proposed in [6], the +L+ dwell time is modeled by a lognormal distribution. All corre- +L+ sponding mean values are shown in table 1. A NRT session +L+ remains active until a specific data volume drawn according to +L+ a bandwidth-dependent lognormal distribution is transferred. +L+ To distinguish between NRT traffic classes, the UMTS simu- +L+ lator implements a WFQ scheduler with three packet priori- +L+ ties: 1 (high), 2 (normal), and 3 (low) with weights w1 = 4, +L+ w2 = 2, and w3 = 1. These priorities correspond to the +L+ traffic handling priority specified by 3GPP. To model the user +L+ behavior in the cell, the simulator considers the handover flow +L+ of active mobile users from adjacent cells. The iterative pro- +L+ cedure introduced in [4] is employed for balancing the incom- +L+ ing and outgoing handover rates. The iteration is based on the +L+ assumption that the incoming handover rate of a user class at +L+ step i + 1 is equal to the corresponding outgoing handover +L+ rate computed at step i .
5.2.1. UMTS system model assumptions
The simulator exactly mimics UMTS system behavior on the +L+ IP level. The focus is not on studying link level dynam- +L+ ics. Therefore, we assume a reliable link layer as provided +L+ by the automatic repeat request (ARQ) mechanism of the +L+ Radio Link Control (RLC) protocol. As shown in [22] for +L+ the General Packet Radio Service (GPRS), the ARQ mecha- +L+ nism is fast enough to recover from packet losses before reli- +L+ able protocols on higher layers (e.g., TCP) recognize these +L+ losses due to timer expiration. Thus, a reliable link level +L+ can be assumed when considering higher layer protocol ac- +L+ tions (see, e.g., [20]). To accurately model the UMTS radio +L+ access network, the simulator represents the functionality of +L+ one radio network controller and seven Node B transceiver +L+ stations, one for each of the considered cells. Since in the +L+ end-to-end path, the wireless link is typically the bottleneck, +L+ and given the anticipated traffic asymmetry, the simulator fo- +L+ cuses on resource contention in the downlink (i.e., the path +L+ RNC → Node B → MS) of the radio interface.
The simulator considers the UTRAN access scheme based +L+ on Wideband-Code Division Multiple Access (W-CDMA) in +L+ Frequency Division Duplex mode (FDD) proposed by 3GPP +L+ [1]. In FDD downlink, a division of the radio frequencies into
IMPROVING QoS AND PROVIDER REVENUE IN 3G MOBILE NETWORKS	217
four physical code channels with data rates of 1,920 kbps each +L+ up to 512 physical code channels with 15 kbps data rates each +L+ is possible. Therefore, the overall bandwidth that is available +L+ in one cell is 7,680 kbps. For the channel coding, we assume +L+ a convolution-coding scheme with coding factor 2. In the ex- +L+ periments without adaptive control the handover bandwidth +L+ portion bh is 5% and the NRT queue threshold η is set to 95%. +L+ The simulation environment was implemented using the sim- +L+ ulation library CSIM [7]. In a presimulation run the handover +L+ flow is balanced, for each cell at the boundary of the seven- +L+ cell cluster. All simulation results are derived with confidence +L+ level of 95% using the batch means method. The execution +L+ of a single simulation run requires about 40–60 min of CPU +L+ time (depending on the call arrival rate) on a dual processor +L+ Sun Sparc Enterprise with one GByte main memory.
5.2.2. Implementation of the hybrid pricing policy in the +L+ simulator
According to the hybrid pricing policy as introduced in sec- +L+ tion 4.2.2, the user’s overall remaining amount of prepaid data +L+ volume d out of the user’s monthly data volume D is deter- +L+ mined at the beginning of a session. Moreover, the remain- +L+ ing amount of data volume of previous months r is deter- +L+ mined. For simulation study purposes, this is accomplished +L+ by choosing the random value d uniformly out of the interval +L+ [0, kD]. kD captures the monthly amount of data a user typ- +L+ ically transfers, i.e., a user typically transfers a multiple k of +L+ the data volume D that is available for a fixed monthly pay- +L+ ment. The random value r, is sampled according to a uniform +L+ distribution out of the interval [0, 0.1 D], where 0.1 D mea- +L+ sures the maximum amount of “unused” data volume of pre- +L+ vious months. If d exceeds D + r the user has no remaining +L+ prepaid data volume, including the data volume of the cur- +L+ rent and the previous months. Otherwise, there is a remaining +L+ amount of prepaid data volume D + r − d for the considered +L+ user and additional pricing arises only, if the transferred data +L+ volume of the user session exceeds D + r − d. Thus, during +L+ the user session the remaining data volume has to be updated +L+ according to the actually transferred data.
In the simulation studies we utilize the proposed hybrid- +L+ pricing scheme with a prepaid monthly data volume of +L+ 150 MB. According to the different priority classes 1, 2, +L+ and 3, the volume-based pricing for transferred data exceed- +L+ ing the prepaid monthly data volume comprises of 20, 15, +L+ and 10 cost-units per MB, respectively. Considering the +L+ changing traffic loads according to the daytime, this approach +L+ can be refined, by the notion of different pricing for daily peri- +L+ ods of time. For the parameterization of the typically monthly +L+ transferred data volume, we assume k = 2. Note that the +L+ parameterization of the pricing scheme is chosen for demon- +L+ stration purposes only. Due to the high flexibility of the hy- +L+ brid pricing scheme, it can be easily extended towards multi- +L+ ple, concurrent pricing schemes comprising of, e.g., different +L+ monthly amounts of prepaid data volumes, different payments +L+ for the individual priority classes, or a pure usage-based pric- +L+ ing as well as pure flat-rate pricing.

traffic.
5.3. Performance results
Using simulation experiments, we illustrate the benefit of the +L+ proposed unified approach for adaptive performance manage- +L+ ment of UMTS systems. In particular, we show the improve- +L+ ment of QoS measures and the increase in revenue earned by +L+ service providers. The presented curves plot the mean values +L+ of the confidence intervals for the considered QoS measures. +L+ In almost all figures, the overall call/session arrival rate of +L+ new mobile users is varied to study the cell under increasing +L+ load conditions. For ease of notation, results with and without +L+ adaptive performance management (APM) are abbreviated by +L+ APM on and APM off, respectively.
In a first experiment, we investigate the effect of adap- +L+ tive control on the threshold for the buffer size of the NRT +L+ queue denoted by η. Figure 2 shows the NRT packet loss +L+ probability (a) and the average number of NRT users in the +L+ cell (b) for the UMTS system with and without adaptive con- +L+ trol. Furthermore, the figures distinguish between different +L+ desired loss levels β as introduced in section 3.2. We observe +L+ that the APM achieves a substantially decrease in packet loss +L+ probability. Moreover, the packet loss probability can be kept +L+ below a constant level for increasing arrival rates of mobile +L+ users. Note, that this level slightly differs from the desired +L+ level of the QoS measure. This is due to the fact that the up- +L+ date function only decreases the NRT threshold if the online

pattern.
measured packet loss probability is greater than 0. There- +L+ fore, the packet loss probability is in steady state also slightly +L+ greater than0. Nevertheless, figure 2 shows that the resulting +L+ packet loss probability can be adjusted quite well. For very +L+ low arrival rates, the packet loss probability is increased com- +L+ pared to the case without adaptive control. This is because +L+ the packet loss probability is below the desired level and q is +L+ adjusted towards 100%.
Figure 2(b) shows the average number of NRT users ad- +L+ mitted in the cell. For all curves, the number of NRT users in +L+ the cell first increases up to about 70 users for an arrival rate of +L+ 1.0 arrivals per second. For higher arrival rates the admission +L+ controller decides to reject requests depending on the choice +L+ of the NRT threshold. In the case without APM the num- +L+ ber of NRT users approaches 100 whereas in the cases with +L+ adaptive control less users are admitted in the cell because +L+ the threshold parameter q is decreased (e.g., about 80 users +L+ for 0 = 0.001). For high arrival rates a slightly decrease +L+ of the average number of NRT users can be observed. This is +L+ due to the fact that with increasing arrival rate the competition +L+ between voice, RT and NRT traffic decreases the bandwidth +L+ capacity available for NRT traffic. Therefore, less NRT users +L+ are admitted.
In the experiment presented in figure 3, we study the ab- +L+ solute number of packet losses observed in one hour for a +L+ transient scenario, i.e., the arrival rate of new calls is chang- +L+ ing every hour according to a half day window of a weekly +L+ usage pattern [15]. The purpose of this experiment is to show +L+ that the adaptive performance management is fast enough to +L+ react on changing traffic conditions, i.e., to effectively adjust +L+ the NRT threshold in order to reduce packet losses. The bars +L+ shown in figure 3 correspond to the number of packet losses +L+ for experiments with and without adaptive control. Further- +L+ more, the figure distinguishes between a desired loss level 0 +L+ of 0.01 and 0.001, respectively. The new call arrival rates con- +L+ sidered in one hour are depicted above the bars. We conclude +L+ from figure 3 that for a real-life pattern of changing arrival +L+ rates the packet losses can be effectively controlled by the +L+ APM. This justifies the choice of the gradient m = −0.02 in +L+ the update function for the NRT threshold. +L+ (b)
Figure 4. Impact of adaptive performance management on handover traffic.
Next, we study the effect of the APM on the handover +L+ traffic. Figure 4 shows the handover failure probability (a) +L+ and the new call blocking probability (b) for the UMTS sys- +L+ tem with and without APM. Similar to figure 2, we distin- +L+ guish between different desired levels 0 for the handover fail- +L+ ure probability. The desired level for new call blocking is +L+ fixed to 0.1. Note, that for controlling the handover band- +L+ width the desired level 0 can be used only to adjust the de- +L+ gree of prioritization of handover failure over new call block- +L+ ing. Distinct from the packet loss probability, it cannot be +L+ expected to keep the handover failure probability at a con- +L+ stant level for increasing traffic load. That is for two rea- +L+ sons: (1) the handover bandwidth is adjusted according to +L+ two QoS measures that have a contrary influence and (2) the +L+ increase of the handover bandwidth must be limited by a +L+ certain portion of the overall available bandwidth (see sec- +L+ tion 3.2). If this limit is reached handover failures occur +L+ more frequently for further increasing call arrival rate. These +L+ two effects can be observed in the curves of figure 4. Nev- +L+ ertheless, the handover failure probability is improved more +L+ than one order of magnitude for call arrival rates between +L+ 0.75 and 1.25 call requests per second and a desired loss +L+ level 0 = 0.001. When studying the blocking probabil- +L+ ity of new voice calls and RT sessions (see figure 4(b)), +L+ we surly observe a higher blocking probability of new calls +L+ in the case with adaptive control and high arrival rate.

fact, almost all call requests are blocked if system load is +L+ high.
In a next experiment, we study the impact of NRT users on +L+ QoS by the adaptive control of the queueing weights as intro- +L+ duced in section 4.2. Figure 5 plots the average throughput +L+ per user for each priority class of NRT traffic. As shown in +L+ table 1, we assume 10% NRT users with high priority, 30% +L+ with normal priority, and 60% with low priority. Recall, that +L+ higher priority service is more expensive and, hence, more +L+ users choose low priority service. If the overall load in the +L+ cell is very low (i.e., less than 0.3 call arrivals per second) +L+ each NRT user receives the maximal throughput independent +L+ of the priority class. However, when the cell load is further +L+ increased (arrival rates of more than 0.5 arrivals per second), +L+ throughput for users of all priority classes decreases. The in- +L+ tention of adaptively controlling the queueing weights is to +L+ reduce heavy throughput degradation of high priority users +L+ in this case. The performance increase of high priority users +L+ and the decrease of low priority users are shown in figure 5. +L+ Figure 6 plots the bandwidth portion utilized for each prior- +L+ ity class of NRT traffic. For low arrival rate (i.e., less than +L+ 0.5 call arrivals per second) NRT users with low priority uti- +L+ lize the greatest portion of the NRT bandwidth because most +L+ NRT users have priority low. When the cell load is increased +L+ (arrival rates of more than 0.5 arrivals per second), the band-

width will be utilized more and more by high priority users. +L+ The adaptive control of the WFQ weights decides to intensify +L+ this effect because users belonging to priority high suffer from +L+ the high population of low priority users. Figures 5 and 6 are +L+ derived from simulation runs with ct = 1/2 (see section 4.2).
In the following experiments, we study the impact of con- +L+ trolling the queueing weights on the revenue function (see +L+ equation (8)) for the three proposed pricing policies, i.e., +L+ usage-based, usage-/throughput-based, and the hybrid pricing +L+ policy. From the revenue function the average (steady state) +L+ provider revenue 0 in the considered cell can be derived. Re- +L+ call that the available bandwidth for NRT traffic is variable for +L+ different call arrival rates. Therefore, we consider the revenue +L+ earned by the provider in one hour per available bandwidth +L+ unit, i.e., per available kbit, for NRT traffic. Figure 7 shows +L+ the provider revenue for the usage-based pricing policy (i.e., +L+ y = 0) and different values of the exponent ct. As discussed +L+ in section 4.2, the best revenue improvement will be achieved +L+ with priority queueing. From the curves we conclude that the +L+ update strategy increases the revenue in one cell successfully +L+ for the considered traffic assumptions. Recall that the revenue +L+ improvement stems from a shift in bandwidth utilization to- +L+ wards higher priority users (see figure 6) if the population of +L+ high priority users is low compared to users of lower priority.
Figure 7(b) shows the revenue improvement for different +L+ user populations. In the experiment the percentage of high

priority users among the arriving user requests is varied. The +L+ remaining users are assumed to be low priority users. Normal +L+ priority users are not considered in this experiment (i.e., 0% +L+ normal priority users). This figure shows how the adaptive +L+ control of the queueing weights works. As expected, for a low +L+ percentage of high priority users the corresponding weight +L+ is increased. Therefore, QoS for high priority users and the +L+ provider revenue is also increased. For more than 50% high +L+ priority users the revenue is the same as in the case without +L+ adaptive control. No further revenue improvement is allowed +L+ because degradation of QoS for low priority users would be +L+ unacceptable. Considering a weak relation among the weights +L+ as introduced in section 4.2 would decrease the revenue com- +L+ pared to the case without adaptive control for more than 50% +L+ high priority users. This might be useful to increase QoS for +L+ users of low population independent of their priority class.
Figure 8 shows the revenue improvement for the usage-/ +L+ throughput-based pricing policy and scaling exponents γ = +L+ 1/4 and γ = 1/16. In the last experiment we studied the +L+ revenue improvement for the hybrid pricing policy (see fig- +L+ ure 9). We assume that half of the arriving users start their +L+ session in non-paying mode (i.e., k = 2). The curves distin-
guish between weights w&apos; = 1 and w&apos; = 2 for the non-paying
users. Furthermore, the revenue for the case with and without +L+ adaptive control is compared. The curves are derived from +L+ simulations with γ = 0 and α = 1/2. From the revenue
curves of figures 7–9 the average monthly revenue can be +L+ computed considering a daily/weekly usage-pattern and dif- +L+ ferent splits of call arrival rates of users requesting different +L+ services (i.e., voice, RT, NRT with different priorities). Com- +L+ paring the monthly revenue for the pricing policies used in +L+ figures 7–9 with the monthly revenue for the hybrid pricing +L+ policy a provider can determine values such as the monthly +L+ free data volume and monthly payment per user.
6. Conclusions
We introduced a unified approach based on a mathematical +L+ framework for the adaptive performance management of 3G +L+ mobile networks. Opposed to previous work [8,13,19,21,25], +L+ the improvement of quality of service (QoS) and the optimiza- +L+ tion of mobile service provider revenue was considered in an +L+ integrated way. The unified approach aims at improving both +L+ QoS for mobile subscribers and increasing revenue earned by +L+ service providers. System parameters controlled by adaptive +L+ performance management constitute the portion of bandwidth +L+ reserved for handovers, the buffer threshold of the queue for +L+ non real-time traffic, and the weights of a weighted fair queue- +L+ ing packet scheduler.
Using the UMTS traffic model of [15] and a simulator on +L+ the IP level for the UMTS system, we presented performance +L+ curves for various QoS measures to illustrate the benefit of +L+ the unified approach for adaptive performance management. +L+ We introduced update functions that effectively control the +L+ packet loss probability and the handover failure probability. +L+ Considering usage-based, usage-/throughput-based, and hy- +L+ brid pricing policies, we showed that the provider revenue in +L+ one cell can be significantly increased by the adaptive control +L+ of the queueing weights.
Throughout the paper, we considered the services and QoS +L+ profiles standardized for UMTS. Thus, the proposed approach +L+ for adaptive control is tailored to UMTS networks. How- +L+ ever, by considering other services and QoS profiles, the ba- +L+ sic ideas underlying the unified approach for adaptive perfor- +L+ mance management can also be applied for the adaptive con- +L+ trol of other kinds of multi-service IP networks.
