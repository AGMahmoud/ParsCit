sectionHeader ||| Abstract
bodyText ||| A number of studies have presented
bodyText ||| machine-learning approaches to semantic
bodyText ||| role labeling with availability of corpora
bodyText ||| such as FrameNet and PropBank. These
bodyText ||| corpora define the semantic roles of predi-
bodyText ||| cates for each frame independently. Thus,
bodyText ||| it is crucial for the machine-learning ap-
bodyText ||| proach to generalize semantic roles across
bodyText ||| different frames, and to increase the size
bodyText ||| of training instances. This paper ex-
bodyText ||| plores several criteria for generalizing se-
bodyText ||| mantic roles in FrameNet: role hierar-
bodyText ||| chy, human-understandable descriptors of
bodyText ||| roles, semantic types of filler phrases, and
bodyText ||| mappings from FrameNet roles to the-
bodyText ||| matic roles of VerbNet. We also pro-
bodyText ||| pose feature functions that naturally com-
bodyText ||| bine and weight these criteria, based on
bodyText ||| the training data. The experimental result
bodyText ||| of the role classification shows 19.16%
bodyText ||| and 7.42% improvements in error reduc-
bodyText ||| tion rate and macro-averaged F 1 score, re-
bodyText ||| spectively. We also provide in-depth anal-
bodyText ||| yses of the proposed criteria.
sectionHeader ||| 1 Introduction
bodyText ||| Semantic Role Labeling (SRL) is a task of analyz-
bodyText ||| ing predicate-argument structures in texts. More
bodyText ||| specifically, SRL identifies predicates and their
bodyText ||| arguments with appropriate semantic roles. Re-
bodyText ||| solving surface divergence of texts (e.g., voice
bodyText ||| of verbs and nominalizations) into unified seman-
bodyText ||| tic representations, SRL has attracted much at-
bodyText ||| tention from researchers into various NLP appli-
bodyText ||| cations including question answering (Narayanan
bodyText ||| and Harabagiu, 2004; Shen and Lapata, 2007;

bodyText ||| tion (Surdeanu et al., 2003).
bodyText ||| In recent years, with the wide availability of cor-
bodyText ||| pora such as PropBank (Palmer et al., 2005) and
bodyText ||| FrameNet (Baker et al., 1998), a number of stud-
bodyText ||| ies have presented statistical approaches to SRL
bodyText ||| (M`arquez et al., 2008). Figure 1 shows an exam-
bodyText ||| ple of the frame definitions for a verb buy in Prop-
bodyText ||| Bank and FrameNet. These corpora define a large
bodyText ||| number of frames and define the semantic roles for
bodyText ||| each frame independently. This fact is problem-
bodyText ||| atic in terms of the performance of the machine-
bodyText ||| learning approach, because these definitions pro-
bodyText ||| duce many roles that have few training instances.
bodyText ||| PropBank defines a frame for each sense of
bodyText ||| predicates (e.g., buy.01), and semantic roles are
bodyText ||| defined in a frame-specific manner (e.g., buyer and
bodyText ||| seller for buy.01). In addition, these roles are asso-
bodyText ||| ciated with tags such as ARG0-5 and AM-*, which
bodyText ||| are commonly used in different frames. Most
bodyText ||| SRL studies on PropBank have used these tags
bodyText ||| in order to gather a sufficient amount of training
bodyText ||| data, and to generalize semantic-role classifiers
bodyText ||| across different frames. However, Yi et al. (2007)
bodyText ||| reported that tags ARG2 –ARG5 were inconsis-
bodyText ||| tent and not that suitable as training instances.
bodyText ||| Some recent studies have addressed alternative ap-
bodyText ||| proaches to generalizing semantic roles across dif-
bodyText ||| ferent frames (Gordon and Swanson, 2007; Zapi-

bodyText ||| FrameNet designs semantic roles as frame spe-
bodyText ||| cific, but also defines hierarchical relations of se-
bodyText ||| mantic roles among frames. Figure 2 illustrates
bodyText ||| an excerpt of the role hierarchy in FrameNet; this
bodyText ||| figure indicates that the Buyer role for the Com-
bodyText ||| merce buy frame (Commerce buy::Buyer here-
bodyText ||| after) and the Commerce sell::Buyer role are in-
bodyText ||| herited from the Transfer:: Recipient role. Al-
bodyText ||| though the role hierarchy was expected to gener-
bodyText ||| alize semantic roles, no positive results for role
bodyText ||| classification have been reported (Baldewein et al.,
bodyText ||| 2004). Therefore, the generalization of semantic
bodyText ||| roles across different frames has been brought up
bodyText ||| as a critical issue for FrameNet (Gildea and Juraf-
bodyText ||| sky, 2002; Shi and Mihalcea, 2005; Giuglea and
bodyText ||| Moschitti, 2006)
bodyText ||| In this paper, we explore several criteria for gen-
bodyText ||| eralizing semantic roles in FrameNet. In addi-
bodyText ||| tion to the FrameNet hierarchy, we use various
bodyText ||| pieces of information: human-understandable de-
bodyText ||| scriptors of roles, semantic types of filler phrases,
bodyText ||| and mappings from FrameNet roles to the thematic
bodyText ||| roles of VerbNet. We also propose feature func-
bodyText ||| tions that naturally combines these criteria in a
bodyText ||| machine-learning framework. Using the proposed
bodyText ||| method, the experimental result of the role classi-
bodyText ||| fication shows 19.16% and 7.42% improvements
bodyText ||| in error reduction rate and macro-averaged F1, re-
bodyText ||| spectively. We provide in-depth analyses with re-
bodyText ||| spect to these criteria, and state our conclusions.
sectionHeader ||| 2 Related Work
bodyText ||| Moschitti et al. (2005) first classified roles by us-
bodyText ||| ing four coarse-grained classes (Core Roles, Ad-
bodyText ||| juncts, Continuation Arguments and Co-referring
bodyText ||| Arguments), and built a classifier for each coarse-
bodyText ||| grained class to tag PropBank ARG tags. Even
bodyText ||| though the initial classifiers could perform rough
bodyText ||| estimations of semantic roles, this step was not
bodyText ||| able to solve the ambiguity problem in PropBank
bodyText ||| ARG2-5. When training a classifier for a seman-
bodyText ||| tic role, Baldewein et al. (2004) re-used the train-
bodyText ||| ing instances of other roles that were similar to the
bodyText ||| target role. As similarity measures, they used the
bodyText ||| FrameNet hierarchy, peripheral roles of FrameNet,
bodyText ||| and clusters constructed by a EM-based method.
bodyText ||| Gordon and Swanson (2007) proposed a general-
bodyText ||| ization method for the PropBank roles based on
bodyText ||| syntactic similarity in frames.
bodyText ||| Many previous studies assumed that thematic
bodyText ||| roles bridged semantic roles in different frames.
bodyText ||| Gildea and Jurafsky (2002) showed that classifica-
bodyText ||| tion accuracy was improved by manually replac-
bodyText ||| ing FrameNet roles into 18 thematic roles. Shi
bodyText ||| and Mihalcea (2005) and Giuglea and Moschitti
bodyText ||| (2006) employed VerbNet thematic roles as the
bodyText ||| target of mappings from the roles defined by the
bodyText ||| different semantic corpora. Using the thematic
bodyText ||| roles as alternatives of ARG tags, Loper et al.
bodyText ||| (2007) and Yi et al. (2007) demonstrated that the
bodyText ||| classification accuracy of PropBank roles was im-
bodyText ||| proved for ARG2 roles, but that it was diminished
bodyText ||| for ARG1. Yi et al. (2007) also described that
bodyText ||| ARG2–5 were mapped to a variety of thematic
bodyText ||| roles. Zapirain et al. (2008) evaluated PropBank
bodyText ||| ARG tags and VerbNet thematic roles in a state-of-
bodyText ||| the-art SRL system, and concluded that PropBank
bodyText ||| ARG tags achieved a more robust generalization of
bodyText ||| the roles than did VerbNet thematic roles.
sectionHeader ||| 3 Role Classification
bodyText ||| SRL is a complex task wherein several problems
bodyText ||| are intertwined: frame-evoking word identifica-
bodyText ||| tion, frame disambiguation (selecting a correct
bodyText ||| frame from candidates for the evoking word), role-
bodyText ||| phrase identification (identifying phrases that fill
bodyText ||| semantic roles), and role classification (assigning
bodyText ||| correct roles to the phrases). In this paper, we fo-
bodyText ||| cus on role classification, in which the role gen-
bodyText ||| eralization is particularly critical to the machine
bodyText ||| learning approach.
bodyText ||| In the role classification task, we are given a
bodyText ||| sentence, a frame evoking word, a frame, and
page ||| 20

figure ||| Role-descriptor groups
figure ||| Thematic-role groups

bodyText ||| phrases that take semantic roles. We are inter-
bodyText ||| ested in choosing the correct role from the can-
bodyText ||| didate roles for each phrase in the frame. Figure 3
bodyText ||| shows a concrete example of input and output; the
bodyText ||| semantic roles for the phrases are chosen from the
bodyText ||| candidate roles: Seller, Buyer, Goods, Reason,
bodyText ||| ... , and Place.
bodyText ||| role at a node in the hierarchy inherits the char-
bodyText ||| acteristics of the roles of its ancestor nodes. For
bodyText ||| example, Commerce sell::Seller in Figure 2 in-
bodyText ||| herits the property of Giving:: Donor.
bodyText ||| For Inheritance, Using, Perspective on, and
bodyText ||| Subframe relations, we assume that descendant
bodyText ||| roles in these relations have the same or special-
bodyText ||| ized properties of their ancestors. Hence, for each
bodyText ||| role yi, we define the following two role groups,
equation ||| Hchild	= {y y = yi V y is a child of yi},
equation ||| yi	= {yly = yi V y is a descendant of yij.
equation ||| Hdesc
equation ||| yi
bodyText ||| The hierarchical-relation groups in Figure 4 are
bodyText ||| the illustrations of Hdesc
equation ||| yi	.
bodyText ||| For the relation types Inchoative of and
bodyText ||| Causative of, we define role groups in the oppo-
bodyText ||| site direction of the hierarchy,
sectionHeader ||| 4 Design of Role Groups	Hparent	= {yjy = yi V y is a parent of yi},
equation ||| 	yi	= {yjy = yi V y is anancestor of yij.
equation ||| 	Hance
equation ||| 	yi
bodyText ||| We formalize the generalization of semantic roles
bodyText ||| as the act of grouping several roles into a
bodyText ||| class. We define a role group as a set of
bodyText ||| role labels grouped by a criterion. Figure 4
bodyText ||| shows examples of role groups; a group Giv-
bodyText ||| ing::Donor (in the hierarchical-relation groups)
bodyText ||| contains the roles Giving::Donor and Com-
bodyText ||| merce pay::Buyer. The remainder of this section
bodyText ||| describes the grouping criteria in detail.
subsectionHeader ||| 4.1 Hierarchical relations among roles
bodyText ||| FrameNet defines hierarchical relations among
bodyText ||| frames (frame-to-frame relations). Each relation
bodyText ||| is assigned one of the seven types of directional
bodyText ||| relationships (Inheritance, Using, Perspective on,
bodyText ||| Causative of, Inchoative of, Subframe, and Pre-
bodyText ||| cedes). Some roles in two related frames are also
bodyText ||| connected with role-to-role relations. We assume
bodyText ||| that this hierarchy is a promising resource for gen-
bodyText ||| eralizing the semantic roles; the idea is that the
bodyText ||| This is because lower roles of Inchoative of
bodyText ||| and Causative of relations represent more neu-
bodyText ||| tral stances or consequential states; for example,
bodyText ||| Killing::Victim is a parent of Death:: Protagonist
bodyText ||| in the Causative of relation.
bodyText ||| Finally, the Precedes relation describes the se-
bodyText ||| quence of states and events, but does not spec-
bodyText ||| ify the direction of semantic inclusion relations.
bodyText ||| Therefore, we simply try Hchild Hdesc Hparent
bodyText ||| yi , yi,yi ,
bodyText ||| and Hynce for this relation type.
subsectionHeader ||| 4.2 Human-understandable role descriptor
bodyText ||| FrameNet defines each role as frame-specific; in
bodyText ||| other words, the same identifier does not appear
bodyText ||| in different frames. However, in FrameNet,
bodyText ||| human experts assign a human-understandable
bodyText ||| name to each role in a rather systematic man-
bodyText ||| ner. Some names are shared by the roles in
bodyText ||| different frames, whose identifiers are dif-
bodyText ||| ferent. Therefore, we examine the semantic
page ||| 21
bodyText ||| commonality of these names; we construct an
bodyText ||| equivalence class of the roles sharing the same
bodyText ||| name. We call these human-understandable
bodyText ||| names role descriptors. In Figure 4, the role-
bodyText ||| descriptor group Buyer collects the roles Com-
bodyText ||| merce pay::Buyer, Commerce buy::Buyer,
bodyText ||| and Commerce sell::Buyer.
bodyText ||| This criterion may be effective in collecting
bodyText ||| similar roles since the descriptors have been anno-
bodyText ||| tated by intuition of human experts. As illustrated
bodyText ||| in Figure 2, the role descriptors group the seman-
bodyText ||| tic roles which are similar to the roles that the
bodyText ||| FrameNet hierarchy connects as sister or parent-
bodyText ||| child relations. However, role-descriptor groups
bodyText ||| cannot express the relations between the roles
bodyText ||| as inclusions since they are equivalence classes.
bodyText ||| For example, the roles Commerce sell::Buyer
bodyText ||| and Commerce buy::Buyer are included in the
bodyText ||| role descriptor group Buyer in Figure 2; how-
bodyText ||| ever, it is difficult to merge Giving:: Recipient
bodyText ||| and Commerce sell::Buyer because the Com-
bodyText ||| merce sell:: Buyer has the extra property that one
bodyText ||| gives something of value in exchange and a hu-
bodyText ||| man assigns different descriptors to them. We ex-
bodyText ||| pect that the most effective weighting of these two
bodyText ||| criteria will be determined from the training data.
subsectionHeader ||| 4.3 Semantic type of phrases
bodyText ||| We consider that the selectional restriction is help-
bodyText ||| ful in detecting the semantic roles. FrameNet pro-
bodyText ||| vides information concerning the semantic types
bodyText ||| of role phrases (fillers); phrases that play spe-
bodyText ||| cific roles in a sentence should fulfill the se-
bodyText ||| mantic constraint from this information. For
bodyText ||| instance, FrameNet specifies the constraint that
bodyText ||| Self motion::Area should be filled by phrases
bodyText ||| whose semantic type is Location. Since these
bodyText ||| types suggest a coarse-grained categorization of
bodyText ||| semantic roles, we construct role groups that con-
bodyText ||| tain roles whose semantic types are identical.
subsectionHeader ||| 4.4 Thematic roles of VerbNet
bodyText ||| VerbNet thematic roles are 23 frame-independent
bodyText ||| semantic categories for arguments of verbs,
bodyText ||| such as Agent, Patient, Theme and Source.
bodyText ||| These categories have been used as consis-
bodyText ||| tent labels across verbs. We use a partial
bodyText ||| mapping between FrameNet roles and Verb-
bodyText ||| Net thematic roles provided by SemLink. 1
bodyText ||| Each group is constructed as a set Tti =
footnote ||| 1http://verbs.colorado.edu/semlink/
bodyText ||| {yISemLink maps y into the thematic role ti}.
bodyText ||| SemLink currently maps 1,726 FrameNet roles
bodyText ||| into VerbNet thematic roles, which are 37.61% of
bodyText ||| roles appearing at least once in the FrameNet cor-
bodyText ||| pus. This may diminish the effect of thematic-role
bodyText ||| groups than its potential.
sectionHeader ||| 5 Role classification method
subsectionHeader ||| 5.1 Traditional approach
bodyText ||| We are given a frame-evoking word e, a frame f
bodyText ||| and a role phrase x detected by a human or some
bodyText ||| automatic process in a sentence s. Let Yf be the
bodyText ||| set of semantic roles that FrameNet defines as be-
bodyText ||| ing possible role assignments for the frame f, and
bodyText ||| let x = {x1, ... , x,,,} be observed features for x
bodyText ||| from s, e and f . The task of semantic role classifi-
bodyText ||| cation can be formalized as the problem of choos-
bodyText ||| ing the most suitable role y� from Yf. Suppose we
bodyText ||| have a model P(yIf, x) which yields the condi-
bodyText ||| tional probability of the semantic role y for given
bodyText ||| f and x. Then we can choose y� as follows:
equation ||| y� = argmax P(y� f, x).	(1)
equation ||| yEYf
bodyText ||| A traditional way to incorporate role groups
bodyText ||| into this formalization is to overwrite each role
bodyText ||| y in the training and test data with its role
bodyText ||| group m(y) according to the memberships of
bodyText ||| the group. For example, semantic roles Com-
bodyText ||| merce sell::Seller and Giving::Donor can be re-
bodyText ||| placed by their thematic-role group Theme::Agent
bodyText ||| in this approach. We determine the most suitable
bodyText ||| role group c� as follows:
equation ||| c� = argmax P-(c�f, x).	(2)
equation ||| cE �-(y)�yEYf}
bodyText ||| Here, P-(c�f, x) presents the probability of the
bodyText ||| role group c for f and x. The role y� is determined
bodyText ||| uniquely iff a single role y E Yf is associated
bodyText ||| with �c. Some previous studies have employed this
bodyText ||| idea to remedy the data sparseness problem in the
bodyText ||| training data (Gildea and Jurafsky, 2002). How-
bodyText ||| ever, we cannot apply this approach when multi-
bodyText ||| ple roles in Yf are contained in the same class. For
bodyText ||| example, we can construct a semantic-type group
bodyText ||| St::State of affairs in which Giving::Reason and
bodyText ||| Giving:: Means are included, as illustrated in Fig-
bodyText ||| ure 4. If c� = St:: State of affairs, we cannot dis-
bodyText ||| ambiguate which original role is correct. In ad-
bodyText ||| dition, it may be more effective to use various
page ||| 22
bodyText ||| groupings of roles together in the model. For in-
bodyText ||| stance, the model could predict the correct role
bodyText ||| Commerce sell::Seller for the phrase “you” in
bodyText ||| Figure 3 more confidently, if it could infer its
bodyText ||| thematic-role group as Theme::Agent and its par-
bodyText ||| ent group Giving::Donor correctly. Although the
bodyText ||| ensemble of various groupings seems promising,
bodyText ||| we need an additional procedure to prioritize the
bodyText ||| groupings for the case where the models for mul-
bodyText ||| tiple role groupings disagree; for example, it is un-
bodyText ||| satisfactory if two models assign the groups Giv-
bodyText ||| ing:: Theme and Theme::Agent to the same phrase.
subsectionHeader ||| 5.2 Role groups as feature functions
bodyText ||| We thus propose another approach that incorpo-
bodyText ||| rates group information as feature functions. We
bodyText ||| model the conditional probability P(y� f, x) by us-
bodyText ||| ing the maximum entropy framework,
equation ||| exp(Ei Aigi(x, y))
equation ||| �( y� f, x) = Ey,Y, exp(Ei Aigi(x, y)). (3)
bodyText ||| Here, G = Jgi� denotes a set of n feature func-
bodyText ||| tions, and A = JAi� denotes a weight vector for
bodyText ||| the feature functions.
bodyText ||| In general, feature functions for the maximum
bodyText ||| entropy model are designed as indicator functions
bodyText ||| for possible pairs of xj and y. For example, the
bodyText ||| event where the head word of x is “you” (xi = 1)
bodyText ||| and x plays the role Commerce sell::Seller in a
bodyText ||| sentence is expressed by the indicator function,
equation ||| 1 (xi =1A
equation ||| y = Commerce sell::Seller)
equation ||| 0 (otherwise)
equation ||| (4)
bodyText ||| We call this kind of feature function an x-role.
bodyText ||| In order to incorporate role groups into the
bodyText ||| model, we also include all feature functions for
bodyText ||| possible pairs of xj and role groups. Equation 5
bodyText ||| is an example of a feature function for instances
bodyText ||| where the head word of x is “you” and y is in the
bodyText ||| role group Theme::Agent,
equation ||| 1 (xi=1A
equation ||| y E Theme::Agent) . (5)
equation ||| 0 (otherwise)
bodyText ||| Thus, this feature function fires for the roles wher-
bodyText ||| ever the head word “you” plays Agent (e.g., Com-
bodyText ||| merce sell::Seller, Commerce buy::Buyer and
bodyText ||| Giving:: Donor). We call this kind of feature func-
bodyText ||| tion an x-group function.
bodyText ||| In this way, we obtain x-group functions for
bodyText ||| all grouping methods, e.g., gtheme
bodyText ||| k, ghierarchy
bodyText ||| k .
bodyText ||| The role-group features will receive more training
bodyText ||| instances by collecting instances for fine-grained
bodyText ||| roles. Thus, semantic roles with few training in-
bodyText ||| stances are expected to receive additional clues
bodyText ||| from other training instances via role-group fea-
bodyText ||| tures. Another advantage of this approach is that
bodyText ||| the usefulness of the different role groups is de-
bodyText ||| termined by the training processes in terms of
bodyText ||| weights of feature functions. Thus, we do not need
bodyText ||| to assume that we have found the best criterion for
bodyText ||| grouping roles; we can allow a training process to
bodyText ||| choose the criterion. We will discuss the contribu-
bodyText ||| tions of different groupings in the experiments.
subsectionHeader ||| 5.3 Comparison with related work
bodyText ||| Baldewein et al. (2004) suggested an approach
bodyText ||| that uses role descriptors and hierarchical rela-
bodyText ||| tions as criteria for generalizing semantic roles
bodyText ||| in FrameNet. They created a classifier for each
bodyText ||| frame, additionally using training instances for the
bodyText ||| role A to train the classifier for the role B, if the
bodyText ||| roles A and B were judged as similar by a crite-
bodyText ||| rion. This approach performs similarly to the over-
bodyText ||| writing approach, and it may obscure the differ-
bodyText ||| ences among roles. Therefore, they only re-used
bodyText ||| the descriptors as a similarity measure for the roles
bodyText ||| whose coreness was peripheral. 2
bodyText ||| In contrast, we use all kinds of role descriptors
bodyText ||| to construct groups. Since we use the feature func-
bodyText ||| tions for both the original roles and their groups,
bodyText ||| appropriate units for classification are determined
bodyText ||| automatically in the training process.
sectionHeader ||| 6 Experiment and Discussion
bodyText ||| We used the training set of the Semeval-2007
bodyText ||| Shared task (Baker et al., 2007) in order to ascer-
bodyText ||| tain the contributions of role groups. This dataset
bodyText ||| consists of the corpus of FrameNet release 1.3
bodyText ||| (containing roughly 150,000 annotations), and an
bodyText ||| additional full-text annotation dataset. We ran-
bodyText ||| domly extracted 10% of the dataset for testing, and
bodyText ||| used the remainder (90%) for training.
bodyText ||| Performance was measured by micro- and
bodyText ||| macro-averaged F 1(Chang and Zheng, 2008) with
bodyText ||| respect to a variety of roles. The micro average bi-
bodyText ||| ases each F1 score by the frequencies of the roles,
footnote ||| 2In FrameNet, each role is assigned one of four different
footnote ||| types of coreness (core, core-unexpressed, peripheral, extra-

page ||| 23
bodyText ||| and the average is equal to the classification accu-
bodyText ||| racy when we calculate it with all of the roles in
bodyText ||| the test set. In contrast, the macro average does
bodyText ||| not bias the scores, thus the roles having a small
bodyText ||| number of instances affect the average more than
bodyText ||| the micro average.
subsectionHeader ||| 6.1 Experimental settings
bodyText ||| We constructed a baseline classifier that uses
bodyText ||| only the x-role features. The feature de-
bodyText ||| sign is similar to that of the previous stud-
bodyText ||| ies (M`arquez et al., 2008). The characteristics
bodyText ||| of x are: frame, frame evoking word, head
bodyText ||| word, content word (Surdeanu et al., 2003),
bodyText ||| first/last word, head word of left/right sister,
bodyText ||| phrase type, position, voice, syntactic path (di-
bodyText ||| rected/undirected/partial), governing category
bodyText ||| (Gildea and Jurafsky, 2002), WordNet super-
bodyText ||| sense in the phrase, combination features of
bodyText ||| frame evoking word & headword, combination
bodyText ||| features of frame evoking word & phrase type,
bodyText ||| and combination features of voice & phrase type.
bodyText ||| We also used PoS tags and stem forms as extra
bodyText ||| features of any word-features.
bodyText ||| We employed Charniak and Johnson’s rerank-
bodyText ||| ing parser (Charniak and Johnson, 2005) to an-
bodyText ||| alyze syntactic trees. As an alternative for the
bodyText ||| traditional named-entity features, we used Word-
bodyText ||| Net supersenses: 41 coarse-grained semantic cate-
bodyText ||| gories of words such as person, plant, state, event,
bodyText ||| time, location. We used Ciaramita and Altun’s Su-
bodyText ||| per Sense Tagger (Ciaramita and Altun, 2006) to
bodyText ||| tag the supersenses. The baseline system achieved
bodyText ||| 89.00% with respect to the micro-averaged F1.
bodyText ||| The x-group features were instantiated similarly
bodyText ||| to the x-role features; the x-group features com-
bodyText ||| bined the characteristics of x with the role groups
bodyText ||| presented in this paper. The total number of fea-
bodyText ||| tures generated for all x-roles and x-groups was
bodyText ||| 74,873,602. The optimal weights A of the fea-
bodyText ||| tures were obtained by the maximum a poste-
bodyText ||| rior (MAP) estimation. We maximized an L2-

bodyText ||| plement each other with respect to semantic role
bodyText ||| generalization. Baldewein et al. (2004) reported
bodyText ||| that hierarchical relations did not perform well for
bodyText ||| their method and experimental setting; however,
bodyText ||| we found that significant improvements could also
bodyText ||| be achieved with hierarchical relations. We also
bodyText ||| tried a traditional label-replacing approach with
bodyText ||| role descriptors (in the third row of Table 1). The
bodyText ||| comparison between the second and third rows in-
bodyText ||| dicates that mixing the original fine-grained roles
bodyText ||| and the role groups does result in a more accurate
bodyText ||| classification.
bodyText ||| By using all types of groups together, the
bodyText ||| model reduced 19.16 % of the classification errors
bodyText ||| from the baseline. Moreover, the macro-averaged
bodyText ||| F1 scores clearly showed improvements resulting
bodyText ||| from using role groups. In order to determine
bodyText ||| the reason for the improvements, we measured
bodyText ||| the precision, recall, and F1-scores with respect
bodyText ||| to roles for which the number of training instances
bodyText ||| was at most 10, 20, and 50. In Table 2, we show
bodyText ||| that the micro-averaged F1 score for roles hav-
bodyText ||| ing 10 instances or less was improved (by 15.46
bodyText ||| points) when all role groups were used. This result
bodyText ||| suggests the reason for the effect of role groups; by
bodyText ||| bridging similar semantic roles, they supply roles
bodyText ||| having a small number of instances with the infor-
bodyText ||| mation from other roles.
subsectionHeader ||| 6.3 Analyses of role descriptors
bodyText ||| In Table 1, the largest improvement was obtained
bodyText ||| by the use of role descriptors. We analyze the ef-
bodyText ||| fect of role descriptors in detail in Tables 3 and 4.

bodyText ||| semantic roles when we use role-descriptor groups
bodyText ||| constructed from each type of coreness (core3, pe-
bodyText ||| ripheral, and extra-thematic) individually. The pe-
bodyText ||| ripheral type generated the largest improvements.
bodyText ||| Table 4 shows the number of roles associated
bodyText ||| with each type of coreness (#roles), the number of
bodyText ||| instances for the original roles (#instances/#role),
bodyText ||| the number of groups for each type of coreness
bodyText ||| (#groups), the number of instances for each group
bodyText ||| (#instances/#group), and the number of roles per
bodyText ||| each group (#roles/#group). In the peripheral
bodyText ||| type, the role descriptors subdivided 1,924 distinct
bodyText ||| roles into 250 groups, each of which contained 7.7
bodyText ||| roles on average. The peripheral type included
bodyText ||| semantic roles such as place, time, reason, dura-
bodyText ||| tion. These semantic roles appear in many frames,
bodyText ||| because they have general meanings that can be
bodyText ||| shared by different frames. Moreover, the seman-
bodyText ||| tic roles of peripheral type originally occurred in
bodyText ||| only a small number (25.24) of training instances
bodyText ||| on average. Thus, we infer that the peripheral
bodyText ||| type generated the largest improvement because
bodyText ||| semantic roles in this type acquired the greatest
bodyText ||| benefit from the generalization.
subsectionHeader ||| 6.4 Hierarchical relations and relation types
bodyText ||| We analyzed the contributions of the FrameNet hi-
bodyText ||| erarchy for each type of role-to-role relations and
bodyText ||| for different depths of grouping. Table 5 shows
bodyText ||| the micro-averaged F1 scores obtained from var-
bodyText ||| ious relation types and depths. The Inheritance
bodyText ||| and Using relations resulted in a slightly better ac-
bodyText ||| curacy than the other types. We did not observe
bodyText ||| any real differences among the remaining five re-
bodyText ||| lation types, possibly because there were few se-

bodyText ||| tained better results by using not only groups for
bodyText ||| parent roles, but also groups for all ancestors. The
bodyText ||| best result was obtained by using all relations in

subsectionHeader ||| 6.5 Analyses of different grouping criteria
bodyText ||| Table 6 reports the precision, recall, and micro-
bodyText ||| averaged F1 scores of semantic roles with respect
bodyText ||| to each coreness type .4 In general, semantic roles
bodyText ||| of the core coreness were easily identified by all
bodyText ||| of the grouping criteria; even the baseline system
bodyText ||| obtained an F 1 score of 91.93. For identifying se-
bodyText ||| mantic roles of the peripheral and extra-thematic
bodyText ||| types of coreness, the simplest solution, the de-
bodyText ||| scriptor criterion, outperformed other criteria.
bodyText ||| In Table 7, we categorize feature functions
bodyText ||| whose weights are in the top 1000 in terms of
bodyText ||| greatest absolute value. The behaviors of the role
bodyText ||| groups can be distinguished by the following two
bodyText ||| characteristics. Groups of role descriptors and se-
bodyText ||| mantic types have large weight values for the first
bodyText ||| word and supersense features, which capture the
bodyText ||| characteristics of adjunctive phrases. The original
bodyText ||| roles and hierarchical-relation groups have strong

footnote ||| performance of semantic roles for each coreness separately.

sectionHeader ||| 7 Conclusion
bodyText ||| We have described different criteria for general-
bodyText ||| izing semantic roles in FrameNet. They were:
bodyText ||| role hierarchy, human-understandable descriptors
bodyText ||| of roles, semantic types of filler phrases, and
bodyText ||| mappings from FrameNet roles to thematic roles
bodyText ||| of VerbNet. We also proposed a feature design
bodyText ||| that combines and weights these criteria using the
bodyText ||| training data. The experimental result of the role
bodyText ||| classification task showed a 19.16% of the error
bodyText ||| reduction and a 7.42% improvement in the macro-
bodyText ||| averaged F1 score. In particular, the method we
bodyText ||| have presented was able to classify roles having
bodyText ||| few instances. We confirmed that modeling the
bodyText ||| role generalization at feature level was better than
bodyText ||| the conventional approach that replaces semantic
bodyText ||| role labels.
bodyText ||| Each criterion presented in this paper improved
bodyText ||| the accuracy of classification. The most success-
bodyText ||| ful criterion was the use of human-understandable
bodyText ||| role descriptors. Unfortunately, the FrameNet hi-
bodyText ||| erarchy did not outperform the role descriptors,
bodyText ||| contrary to our expectations. A future direction
bodyText ||| of this study would be to analyze the weakness of
bodyText ||| the FrameNet hierarchy in order to discuss possi-
bodyText ||| ble improvement of the usage and annotations of

bodyText ||| Since we used the latest release of FrameNet
bodyText ||| in order to use a greater number of hierarchical
bodyText ||| role-to-role relations, we could not make a direct
bodyText ||| comparison of performance with that of existing
bodyText ||| systems; however we may say that the 89.00% F 1
bodyText ||| micro-average of our baseline system is roughly
bodyText ||| comparable to the 88.93% value of Bejan and
bodyText ||| Hathaway (2007) for SemEval-2007 (Baker et al.,
bodyText ||| 2007). 5 In addition, the methodology presented in
bodyText ||| this paper applies generally to any SRL resources;
bodyText ||| we are planning to determine several grouping cri-
bodyText ||| teria from existing linguistic resources and to ap-
bodyText ||| ply the methodology to the PropBank corpus.
