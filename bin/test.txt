The Construction of a
Political Value
I. INTRODUCTION
My subject is freedom and in particular freedom as a political value. Many
discussions of this topic consist of trying to deWne the idea of freedom,
or various ideas of freedom. I do not think that we should be interested
in deWnitions. I leave aside the very general philosophical point that if
we mean, seriously, deWnitions, there are no very interesting deWnitions
of anything. There is a more particular reason. In the case of ethical and
political ideas, what puzzles and concerns us is the understanding of
those ideas—in the present case, freedom—as a value for us in our world.
I do not mean that we are interested in it only as it Wgures in precisely
our set of values—meaning by that, those of a liberal democratic society.
Manifestly it is equally part of our world that such ideas are also used by
those who do not share our values or only partly share them—those with
whom we are in confrontation, discussion, negotiation, or competition,
with whom in general we share the world. Indeed, we will disagree among
ourselves about freedom within our own society. We experience conXicts
between freedom and other values, and—a point I shall emphasize—we
understand some desirable measures as involving a cost in freedom.
Whatever our various relations may be with others in our world who
do or do not share our conception of freedom, we will not understand
our own speciWc relations to that value unless we understand what we
want that value to do for us—what we, now, need it to be in shaping our

own institutions and practices, in disagreeing with those who want to
shape them diVerently, and in understanding and trying to co-exist with
those who live under other institutions.
In all their occurrences, these various conceptions or understandings
of freedom, including the ones we immediately need for ourselves, in-
volve a complex historical deposit, and we will not understand them
unless we grasp something of that deposit, of what the idea of freedom,
in these various connections, has become. This contingent historical
deposit, which makes freedom what it now is, cannot be contained in or
anticipated by anything that could be called a deWnition. It is the same
here as it is with other values: philosophy, or as we might say a priori
anthropology, can construct a core or skeleton or basic structure for the
value, but both what it has variously become, and what we now need it
to be, must be a function of actual history. In the light of this, we can say
that our aim is not to deWne but to construct a conception of freedom.
I shall not attempt a general account of what might count as construct-
ing one or another conception of freedom. One might say that the no-
tion of construction applies at diVerent levels. We need to construct a
value of freedom speciWcally for us; and we need a more generic con-
struction or plan of freedom which helps us to place other conceptions
of it in a philosophical and historical space—which shows us, one might
say, how other speciWc conceptions might be constructed in their own
right. Some of the questions raised by these requirements would simply
be a matter of terminology, of how we might use the term ‘construction.’
But there is a more signiWcant consideration which links these two lev-
els. The conception of freedom we need for ourselves is both historically
self-conscious and suitable to a modern society—and those two features
are of course related to one another. Because of this, our own speciWc
and active conception of freedom, the one we need for our practical pur-
poses, will contain implicitly the materials for a reXective understand-
ing of the more general possibilities of construction.
However, it is just as important that the disputes that have circled
around the various deWnitions and concepts of liberty do not just repre-
sent a set of verbal misunderstandings. They have been disagreements
about something. There is even a sense in which they have been dis-
agreements about some one thing. There must be a core, or a primitive
conception, perhaps some universal or widely spread human experience,
to which these various conceptions relate. This does not provide, as it

Political Value
were, the ultimate deWnition. Indeed, this core or primitive item, I am
going to suggest, is certainly not a political value, and perhaps not a value
at all. But it can, and must, explain how these various accounts of the
value of freedom are elaborations of the same thing, that these various
interpretations are not just talking past each other.
There is another consideration which the familiar philosophical dis-
putes and attempts at deWnition indeed take for granted, but they do not
give the right weight to it. In the sense that concerns these discussions,
freedom is a political value. (They are not addressing, for instance, meta-
physical questions about the freedom of the will.) I am going to suggest
that this point itself, when it is properly understood, has a very signiW-
cant eVect on the kind of construction we should be trying to achieve. In
particular, we must take seriously the point that because it is a political
value, the most important disagreements that surround it are political
disagreements. What kinds or registers of politics are involved, what the
relevant understanding of politics will be, will depend on which disagree-
ments are at issue—those within our own society, for instance, or those
with other societies. But our overall construction of freedom as a politi-
cal value must allow the fact that it is a political value to be central and
intelligible.
I am certainly not going to oVer a deWnition or any general character-
ization of the political. That would once again be impossible. But it may
be helpful to mention now four things I believe to be true about the po-
litical, which will shape the discussion and aVect my overall construc-
tion of freedom as a political value.
(a) First, a point about philosophy: political philosophy is not just ap-
plied moral philosophy, which is what in our culture it is often taken to
be.1 Nor is it just a branch of legal philosophy, a point that will concern us
later. In particular, political philosophy must use distinctively political
concepts, such as power, and its normative relative, legitimation.
Philosophy & Public AVairs

(b) The idea of the political is to an important degree focused in the
idea of political disagreement; and political disagreement is signiWcantly
diVerent from moral disagreement. Moral disagreement is characterized
by a class of considerations, by the kinds of reasons that are brought to
bear on a decision. Political disagreement is identiWed by a Weld of appli-
cation—eventually, about what should be done under political author-
ity, in particular through the deployment of state power. The reasons that
go into political decisions and arguments that bear on them may be of
very various kinds. Because of this, political disagreement is not merely
moral disagreement, and it need not necessarily involve it, though it may
do so; equally, it need not necessarily be a disagreement simply of inter-
ests, though of course it may be.
(c) Possible political disagreements include disagreements about the
interpretation of political values, such as freedom, equality, or justice.
These disagreements may involve many diVerent kinds of understand-
ing and political traditions; they can tap into various areas of what I called
the historical deposit. It follows that the relation of these values to each
other cannot be established on the model of interpreting a constitution,
where questions typically take the form of determining what counts as,
say, limiting the freedom of speech. Of course, there is such an activity,
and it plays an important part in some cultures, such as that of the United
States. But even in those cases, it would be a mistake to equate political
thought about questions of principle with thought about actual or ideal
constitutional interpretation.2 We and our political opponents—even our
opponents in one polity, let alone those in others—are not just trying to
read one text. This will be an important point in what follows.
(d) The last of these preliminary signals is provided by that word “op-
ponents.” Carl Schmitt famously said that the fundamental political re-
lation was that of friend and enemy.3 This is an ambiguous remark, and
it can take on a rather sinister tone granted the history of Schmitt’s own
relations to the Weimar Republic and eventually to the Third Reich. But
it is basically true in at least this sense, that political diVerence is of the
From Freedom to Liberty:

essence of politics, and political diVerence is a relation of political oppo-
sition, rather than, in itself, a relation of intellectual or interpretative dis-
agreement. Many things can be covered by the idea of “opposition” it-
self. But they all bring with them the question of how we understand our
opponents, how far our opposition is a matter of interests, how far a
matter of principle, what sentiments are engaged, why we and they feel
so strongly about it if we do, and in what ways we each diVerently tap
into the historical deposit. We may for various reasons think that our
opponents are, among other things, in intellectual error, but the rela-
tions of political opposition cannot simply be understood in terms of
intellectual error. Our construction of freedom as a political value must
make sense of the fact that disagreements involving that value are typi-
cally matters of political opposition, and that this carries substantial
implications about the ways in which we should regard the disagreement,
and regard our opponents themselves.
II. PRIMITIVE FREEDOM
Some of the arguments I shall consider are, inevitably, very familiar. My
excuse for putting on parade some of the usual suspects from Political
Philosophy 101 is rather like that which Descartes oVered when he ex-
cused himself for “warming up the stale cabbage” of ancient skeptical
arguments.4 He admitted that the materials were very familiar, but he
thought that it made all the diVerence what you wanted to do with them.
They had to serve a particular method, and he wanted to illustrate that
method. More modestly, my aim is the same: the usual suspects have to
be put to work, but on a rather diVerent task.
Mill, in Chapter 5 of On Liberty, says, informally enough: “liberty con-
sists in doing what one desires.” He cannot quite mean this: he must at
any rate mean the capacity to do what one desires (you are not unfree if
you simply choose not to do something you desire.) Amended in this
way, Mill agrees with Locke: “Liberty, ‘tis plain, consists in a power to do
or not to do; to do or forbear doing as we will. This cannot be denied.”5
This is an idea of liberty as ability or capacity. It has an obvious disad-
vantage: we already have a concept of ability or capacity, and on this

showing ‘liberty’ or ‘freedom’ turn out boringly just to be other names
for it. More importantly, it misses the point of why we want these terms
in the Wrst place. That point is registered for the Wrst time when we add to
this kind of account a further condition, which concerns the kind of ob-
stacle that is stopping us from doing something we want to do. We say,
more narrowly, that we are unfree if our inability is the product, speciW-
cally, of coercion, where that is taken, at least in the central cases, to
mean—using the term ‘coercion’ in a broad sense—the intentional ob-
structive activities of other people. This is incorporated in Isaiah Berlin’s
famous account of “negative” liberty, and of course, as he noted, it goes
back a long way.6 Berlin quotes, for one, Helvétius: “The free man is the
man who is not in irons, nor imprisoned in a gaol, nor terrorized like a
slave by the fear of punishment … it is not lack of freedom, not to Xy like
an eagle or swim like a whale.” Though I shall be concerned with what
Berlin called “negative freedom,” I shall not use that term nor discuss the
distinction between “negative” and “positive” freedom itself. (It is mis-
leading in several respects, particularly if it is identiWed, as it is some-
times by Berlin, with a distinction between “freedom from” and “free-
dom to”.)7 The simple idea of being unobstructed in doing what you want
by some form of humanly imposed coercion, I shall call “primitive free-
dom.”
The range of obstacles, those identiWed with “coercion,” can itself be
interpreted more or less broadly. Some candidates, ordered roughly from
the obvious and agreed to the more disputable, are:
(A) Prevention by force (Helvétius’s irons and gaol);
(B) Threats of force, penalties, social rejection, and so forth
(Helvétius’s fear of punishment);8
(C) Competition in (something like) a zero-sum game, where one
competitor sets out to stop another reaching his goal;

9
The Construction of a
Political Value
(D) By-products of another enterprise, not aimed at the agent;
(E) By-products of an arrangement which structurally disadvantages
(those in the position of) the agent.
Some of these variations will concern us later. There is an obvious di-
vision in the list, between cases in which an agent’s activities are deliber-
ately directed against another agent’s capacity to do something, and those
in which they merely bring about that the agent loses that capacity. There
is a further extension beyond this, where what is in question is someone’s
omission or failure to remove an obstacle to the other agent’s capacity.
However, this requires more background, in particular the political frame-
work at which we shall eventually arrive, to make it reasonable to say
that the person in question has “failed” or “omitted” to do something
about this obstacle—that is to say, that this person should do something
about it. The more it can be said that there is a person or agency in this
position, the wider the range of complaints in freedom may be. How-
ever, we should not conclude from this that we should drop the refer-
ence to coercive or limiting action altogether and revert to the concep-
tion of freedom as simply power or capacity.9 We shall come back shortly
to the basic question of why this restriction to obstacles that are intended
by other agents, or created by them, or at the very least not removed by
them, should be so signiWcant.
III. FREEDOM AS A RATIO CONCEPT
First, however, there is a diVerent point to be made about primitive free-
dom. Primitive freedom is a ratio concept: it is a matter of the ratio be-
tween what people desire to do and what they are prevented by others
from doing. This implies that there are two ways to increase people’s free-
dom. I may remove the forces or obstacles that prevent them from satis-
fying their desires. But equally I may bring it about that they do not have
desires that cannot be satisWed. This leads to a paradox. Suppose, im-
plausibly and for the sake of argument, that there were a body of entirely
contented slaves. They are not physically abused, and they do not want
to do any of the things their slavery prevents them from doing. Under
this concept of freedom, they are free. If reformers appear and tell them
Philosophy & Public AVairs
10
what they are missing and make them for the Wrst time discontented, it
might even be said that it is the reformers who have taken away their
freedom. A concept of freedom that leads to this cannot be adequate.
One reaction to this is to say that freedom should be measured not in
terms of what people actually desire, but in terms of what they should
reasonably, properly, or appropriately desire. This idea can take various
forms. It can also be applied not just to a deWcit of appropriate desire, as
in the case of the slaves, but to an excess of inappropriate desire, as in-
deed it has been by moralists in the Stoic tradition. The construction of
freedom as a political value should certainly leave room for arguments
of this form: besides the familiar answer to a complaint in freedom, that
the constraint on desire is necessary (for instance in the interests of oth-
ers), there is a possible answer in some cases that the desire is unreason-
able and the agent would be better oV without it. In particular, he would
be more free. But as a general principle of argument, this runs the risk of
heading in the direction of what Berlin called “positive freedom”: at the
limit, the argument will be heard that coercive force can be justiWed to
prevent the formation of inappropriate desires or to encourage the for-
mation of appropriate ones, so that people, as Rousseau put it, can be
forced to be free. That notorious phrase has rightly been seen as para-
doxical.10 What is true, though, is that this kind of idea is not simply an
arbitrary appropriation of the word “freedom”—it is rooted in certain
features of the concept, although it develops them in an irresponsible
way.11
There is another way of dealing with the ratio paradox, which appeals
not to a normatively approved list of desires, but rather to some special
explanations of why people do not have certain desires they might be
expected to have. So in the slave case, the absence of a desire for free-
dom may diagnosed as itself a product of coercion: it is precisely be-
cause of the way in which they are treated, prevented from hearing of
other options and so on, that the state of their desires is as it is. The idea
of this is the same as that employed in the Critical Theory test for beliefs
which supposedly legitimate some prima facie oppressive institution:
From Freedom to Liberty:
11
The Construction of a
Political Value
whether the belief is the product of the coercion which it supposedly
helps to legitimate. The principle of these tests seems entirely sound and
to Xow naturally from the structure of the idea of coercion; the problem
with them is of course going to lie in the prospects of making good an
interpretation in these terms in any given case. We shall come back to
the happy slaves later, and try to Wx rather more deWnitely where the Criti-
cal Theory test Wts into the construction of liberty.
IV. WHY COERCION?
Why should we pick on, speciWcally, primitive freedom, with its concen-
tration on human sources of constraint, as the starting point? The an-
swer is that primitive freedom is, as we might put it, a “proto-political”
concept. This does not merely mean that if we are interested in freedom
as a political value (as we are), this is the place to start. It means some-
thing stronger: that this is the place to start because it involves a quite
basic human phenomenon, and that phenomenon already points in the
direction of politics.
In a frequently quoted remark, Heracleitus said “They would not have
known the name of justice, if it had not been for these things,” and it is
virtually certain that “these things” are disputes, quarrels, and conXict.12
Justice, hence an authoritative source of justice, hence an empowered
enforcer of justice, is needed to impose solutions on what would other-
wise be unbounded conXicts of interest. Similarly, the restriction of our
activities by the intentional activities of others, as contrasted with the
ubiquitous limitations we face in nature, can give rise to a quite speciWc
reaction, resentment; and if resentment is not to express itself in more
conXict, non-cooperation, and dissolution of social relations, an authori-
tative determination is needed of whose activities should have priority
(needless to say, that determination itself may well use concepts of jus-
tice.) In an appropriate context, resentment can be directed to inaction,
to a refusal to remove some obstacle if it can be claimed that it is the
other party’s business to remove it. But it cannot extend to what are rec-
ognized as blankly the obstacles of nature. Rousseau’s distinction be-
tween being conWned in one’s house by a snowstorm and being locked
in it by someone else remains in place.13
Philosophy & Public AVairs
12
But now there is a further development peculiarly connected with free-
dom. As soon as the authoritative source is indeed empowered and de-
ploys coercion to enforce its rulings, that coercion itself can give rise to
resentment. Questions arise of how that power is being used, questions
that demand legitimating accounts. Those questions are likely to become
more pressing, the closer the situation comes to that in which the au-
thority uniquely commands the means of some kinds of coercion (such
as (A) above, and to some extent (B))—that is to say, the closer it comes
to the ideal type of there being a state. To various degrees in diVerent
societies, these questions will be the subject of discussion. The political,
in some of its many forms, now exists.
V. TOWARDS LIBERTY
We do not yet have freedom as a political value: a political value which
from now on, making a distinction I have not used up to now, I shall call
liberty.
Primitive freedom is not itself that political value.14 We can see this by
considering an idea which arises as soon as we have the conditions of
the political, that is to say, an authority, together with appeals to that
authority. This is the idea of a claim in liberty. The following points are
obvious:
(a) No one can intelligibly make a claim against others simply on
the ground that the activities of those others restrict his primitive free-
dom, or that the extension of his primitive freedom requires action by
them. At best, that is the start of a quarrel, not a claim to its solution.
(b) Similarly, no sane person can expect that his primitive freedom
merely as such should be protected.
(c) Equally, suppose that someone uses the notion of a right: no sane
person can think that he has a right against others to what is demanded
by his primitive freedom as such (i.e., to anything he happens to want.)
(d) A similar point can be made in terms of the good: no one can
intelligibly think that it is good (period, as opposed to good for him) that
his primitive freedom should be unlimited.
The eVect of these points is that the resolution of questions of how far
a person’s freedom should be protected or extended, how far it is good
From Freedom to Liberty:
13
The Construction of a
Political Value
that it should be, how far he has a right that it should be, requires some
degree of impartiality (a general point of view, in Hume’s phrase) which
is not contained in the idea of an individual’s primitive freedom as such.
The importance of these points has been emphasized by Ronald
Dworkin.15 However, he assumes that a claim in liberty must be a claim
to a speciWc kind of right to do the thing in question, such as a right of
free speech. He concludes from this that there can be no conXicts be-
tween liberty, properly understood, and any rightful claim. For suppose
some other value, such as equality or more generally justice, when prop-
erly interpreted, requires that I not do a certain thing. Then I have no
right to do that thing. So I cannot correctly make a claim in liberty to do
it, and so, if I am prevented from doing it, this cannot be a restriction on
my liberty (though it is of course a restriction of primitive freedom.)
It cannot be necessary that this conclusion should follow from the
understanding of liberty. Indeed, in my view, it is necessary that it should
not follow. We are constructing liberty as a political value, which means
among other things that we can make sense of its role in political argu-
ment and political conXict, and generally of the experience of life under
a political order. It is one datum of that experience that people can even
recognize a restriction as rightful under some political value such as
equality or justice, and nevertheless regard it as a restriction on liberty.
The notion of a cost in liberty is at least as well entrenched in historical
and contemporary experience as that of a rightful claim in liberty.
This notion of a cost in liberty can apply, I just suggested, even to
people who agree with some restrictive measure, introduced for instance
in the interests of equality—they can still regard it as a restriction on lib-
erty, though a justiWed one. Dworkin’s view cannot make sense of the
attitude of such people: on his view, they are merely confused. But the
point about a cost in liberty applies even more signiWcantly to those who
do not agree that the cost is necessary. The state enacts, by quite proper
process, some measure in the name of equality, say, which restricts the
activities of some people. Those people oppose it, and let us suppose
that they oppose it on principle: they do not accept the ideal of equality,
or this application of it, or this way of going about it. They certainly re-
Philosophy & Public AVairs
14
gard the measure as a restriction on their liberty. Dworkin’s view can in
its own terms give a coherent account of this reaction (they do not think
the measure is rightful), but it now raises a diVerent question: suppose
we are supporters of the measure, what attitude should we take towards
the people who have this reaction, our political opponents? Since we think
that they are wrong in opposing the measure, speciWcally in denying that
the measure is justiWed in the name of equality, we must suppose, on
Dworkin’s view, that they are wrong in thinking that their liberty is being
restricted. They are coerced by the state, they resent it, they vividly think
that their liberty is curtailed. Dworkin patiently explains to them that
they are simply wrong in thinking this; they may think that there is a cost
in liberty, their liberty, but there is not. This is exactly the attitude that
Rousseau thought appropriate, and it seems to me just as objectionable
now as it was with him.
We should take seriously the idea that if, under certain conditions,
people think that there is a cost in liberty, then there is. Taking that idea
seriously, I suggest, is a condition not only of taking seriously the idea of
political opposition, but of taking our political opponents themselves
seriously.
There is one class of complainants about costs in liberty whom, I think,
we need not take seriously: those who complain that their liberty, or in-
deed their primitive freedom, is curtailed by the mere existence of a state.
Certainly not their liberty: since liberty is freedom as a political value, no
complaint is a complaint in liberty if it would apply to any political sys-
tem or any state whatsoever, so the existence of the state is not itself an
oVense against or limitation on liberty (though some particular forms of
the state may of course readily be so.) Moreover, this is not simply a ver-
bal point about the understanding of “liberty”; we need not agree, either,
that the fact that a person is subject to a state is, in itself, a limitation on
his primitive freedom. The reason for this is that the amount of freedom
that a person would have without the state is entirely indeterminate or,
at any rate, very small. Two conclusions follow about anarchism: from
the point about liberty it follows that is not a political position, and from
the point about primitive freedom, that it is not interesting, and I hap-
pily accept both these conclusions.

VI. BEYOND CLAIMS IN LIBERTY
The Rousseau outlook (as we might call it) fails to make sense of an en-
tirely familiar reaction that is basic to politics and to the understanding
of political opposition. For that reason, it does not encourage a helpful—
one might say, healthy—relation to one’s opponents. What we should take
seriously are their reactions, or at least their deeper reactions, rather than
the extent to which we are disposed to share or morally approve of their
reactions, and this applies in diVerent forms whether they are opponents
outside our polity or opponents within it. There is a potentially instruc-
tional, potentially patronizing, element in the Rousseau outlook which,
to take just the case of local opponents, is hostile to the relations of fel-
low citizenship which we must hope can co-exist with political opposi-
tion — so long at least that we believe that there should be one polity and
political opposition has not irreparably divided it. Indeed, this moral-
ized outlook in some of its more spectacular historical expressions, such
as the Terror, has shown that it can destroy not just citizenship but citi-
zens.
The philosophical fault at the heart of this outlook might be said to be
this, that it bases the idea of liberty on that of a rightful claim in liberty.
The notion of a claim in liberty, I have said, is useful in distinguishing
liberty from primitive freedom in the Wrst place. It can do this because
any adequate idea of liberty must at any rate accommodate the idea of a
claim in liberty, and the idea of primitive freedom, in itself, cannot do so
at all. But the idea of a rightful claim in liberty implies a juridical concep-
tion, of an agreed authority which can rightfully grant or refuse such a
claim, and political opponents do not necessarily understand their situ-
ation in these terms. As I put it earlier, they are not all interpreting the
same text.
In the case of opponents in diVerent political systems, they may not
agree on terms in which such an authority, if they imagined it to exist,
might legitimate its decisions to them. Between opponents who share a
polity and neither of whom wants to destroy it, they will agree on an au-
thority or process which decides what will happen, but this is not at all
equivalent to the authority’s deciding that one or another claim in lib-
Philosophy & Public AVairs
16
erty is rightful. The reason for this lies in a characteristic of the political
that I mentioned before, that political disagreements are not identiWed
through the kinds of reasons that are deployed in them. The reasons for
which an agreed political authority decides what will happen are vari-
ous, and the decision in various ways may aVect people’s liberty, but the
decision is not itself an announcement of what is a rightful claim in lib-
erty.
In the very special case of a polity that has an institution of judicial
review, executive and legislative decisions can be checked against claims
in liberty. In such a state, some political decisions, in the widest sense,
are judicial ones: i.e., the decision which decides what will happen is
made for judicial reasons. (This is not the same as the familiar charge, in
criticism of such an institution or of its operation, that some of these
judicial decisions are, in a narrower sense, political ones.) But even here
the sense that one’s liberty is restricted by a decision cannot be identi-
Wed with the thought that the court, if it acted rightly, would grant or
would have granted or indeed should have granted one’s claim in liberty.
One may agree that the court, if it was doing its job properly, would not
have granted such a claim, but one can still feel that the decision re-
stricts or even violates one’s liberty. First, the court itself may accept that
its decision, though rightful, involves a cost in liberty.16 A more general
reason, however, is that judicial reasons, the kinds of reason that a con-
stitutional court, however inventive, must attend to, are only one kind of
reason. (Even those such as Dworkin who think that judicial review should
include explicit and wide-ranging moral reasons accept that since these
are decisions within a given legal system, they are bound by other con-
straints, such as stare decisis.) So the person who feels his liberty injured
may feel this in virtue of other reasons, indeed other reasons of prin-
ciple, which he does not suppose would vindicate a claim of right in the
judicial forum. If he is angry at the outcome, then the focus of his anger
might be this, that things are such that the Wnal court of appeal must
rightfully decide against him, and this thought might survive the under-
standing that given the legal history and the court’s situation there was
no realistic alternative to things being this way.
From Freedom to Liberty:
17
The Construction of a
Political Value
The thought that an action, say a political decision, involves a cost in
one’s liberty does not necessarily involve the thought that one would have
a rightful claim in liberty before some speciWed or indeed unspeciWed
authority. So what does go into the idea of a cost in liberty? We should
recall that we are trying to construct this idea as part of constructing an
idea of liberty itself which will serve our needs. The construction started
from certain experiences associated with perceived limitations on primi-
tive freedom. We should turn back to that again, and approach the con-
struction of the idea of a cost in liberty by considering what it is to feel
that something involves a cost in one’s liberty.
VII. RESENTMENT AND OTHER SUCH REACTIONS
When I considered in the Wrst place the transition from primitive free-
dom to liberty, I said that the reaction to coercion in the most elemen-
tary case was resentment. But the experience of feeling that one’s liberty
is being restricted need not necessarily take the form of resentment. How
far it can be expected to do so is not an easy question to pursue, because
resentment so readily merges into other negative feelings, such as anger
and dislike, not just for conceptual but also for various familiar psycho-
logical reasons. In relation to freedom, the primitive and purest case of
resentment is perhaps that in which another person acts manifestly and
eVectively in a way that prevents me from doing what I want, and does
so with that intention, and I think, moreover, that there is nothing to be
said at all in favor of his doing so from any point of view except his. There
are of course many cases of resentment in which this strongest condi-
tion is not satisWed. I may think, for instance, that the action was in my
long-term interests, even that it was done with that intention, and still I
may resent it. (Of course there may be a problem in such a case of sort-
ing out what exactly it is that I resent—I may just resent, for instance, the
fact that he took for granted his own ideas about my interests.)
It is usually said that the particular reaction of resentment is tied to
the idea of the other person’s action being not rightful. If we accept this
idea, and also identify as (necessarily) resentment the feelings that go
with a sense of a restriction on one’s liberty, we shall be back on the road
to Rousseau’s outlook. But I think that we should loosen both these con-
nections. Resentment is not so closely tied to the idea of right,17 and a
Philosophy & Public AVairs

sense of coercion or restricted liberty can be connected to reactions that
range more widely than resentment in the strictest sense. A helpful con-
sideration here is the extent to which the person whose liberty is in ques-
tion is identiWed with the actions that might be felt to restrict or violate
that liberty. This idea helps us to explain the case of the citizen who thinks
that a certain political decision is both procedurally correct and right in
principle, but nevertheless experiences its consequences for himself as
a cost in liberty. The reason that this is possible is that his sense of him-
self is not entirely that of a person identiWed with the state’s decisions,
however rightful. Rousseau of course wanted each person in a virtuous
republic to be identiWed totally with himself or herself as citizen, but it is
inevitable and appropriate and an entirely good thing that on any con-
ception of a modern society—and I suspect also, on a realistic concep-
tion of any society whatsoever—this is not going to be so.18
Someone who disapproves of a measure in principle but not on pro-
cedural grounds is less identiWed with it than someone who approves of
it in both these respects. Someone who Wnds it both procedurally and in
principle objectionable is even less identiWed with it, and one who thinks
that all the procedures are a sham is less identiWed still. At the end of this
line, when the action that constrains someone is experienced as nothing
but coercion, sheer force in the interests of others, the lack of identiWca-
tion is total, and this certainly is resentment. But right from the begin-
ning of this progression there is room for the idea that the action, what-
ever there is to be said for it, is a limitation of someone’s liberty, to the
extent that he identiWes with the desires and projects which this action
will frustrate.
It is not a necessary condition of there being a cost in someone’s lib-
erty or a restriction of it that he has such experiences of resentment, frus-
tration, or whatever. This takes us back to a point we noticed earlier in
this construction, in the example of the happy slaves. We deplore their
by an action projects on it the idea that it is not rightful. But then the idea of right must be
salient in those particular cases, precisely because the reaction is identiWed as a moralistic
rationalization. We can recognize resentment in less moralized circumstances: for instance,
where A bears a grudge against B because B beat him (fairly) in a contest.

lack of liberty; they—we are fancifully supposing—do not. But if they do
not, is there anything, on the present line, on which we can build our
complaint? I suggested earlier that there is, in what I called the Critical
Theory principle. The slaves are subject to a regime which (simply as a
matter of fact) would pursue much the same objectives whatever they
desired. We are supposing that they do not experience any frustration,
although they are not allowed to satisfy some desires that human beings
in general might be expected to have (e.g., they cannot marry or travel or
stop work.) In actual fact, of course, it is very unlikely that they will not
feel frustrated in these respects, which is what makes this a rather objec-
tionable fantasy, but suppose it to be so. In addition, they do not have
certain other desires or aspirations which others have in those historical
circumstances, such as a desire for political representation. In both re-
spects, the state of their desires is identiWably a product of that regime, a
regime, moreover, which would not be responsive even if they had the
desires in question. In those circumstances, the absence of the desires
does not refute the complaint in liberty, once it is made; if anything, it
gives it extra force. It is the Critical Theory principle that explains, I think,
why a complaint in liberty is not turned away in such a situation, and
hence why the presence of frustrated desire is not a necessary condition
of a cost in liberty.19
VIII. LIBERTY NOW
Let us try to assemble some conditions on liberty. We may recall
(i) A practice is not a violation of liberty if it is necessarily involved
in there being a state at all.
However,
(ii) The principle of (i) cannot be relativized to a particular state or
polity, since particular states or polities can obviously be criticized for
violations or undue restrictions of liberty. At the same time, there is
Philosophy & Public AVairs
20
limited interest in comparing all existing states to some ideal model
of a state. In particular, what desires or frustrations people might have
under increasingly counterfactual conditions is increasingly indeter-
minate. Utopian political discourse is of course possible and may have
its uses, but it is at best obliquely related to arguments about the lib-
erty we can hope to Wnd in our world. This is not to say that Utopian
discourses about liberty are analytically or deWnitionally incoherent.
In terms of the broadest construction of liberty, we can Wnd a place
for some of them, if they are not otherwise too incoherent. But they,
and the comparisons they invite with the actual, do not do much for
the more speciWc construction of liberty as a value for us.
In pursuing that construction, it seems to me that we should restrict the
Utopia factor by accepting in particular that
(iii) Modernity is a basic category of social and hence of political un-
derstanding, and so a politically useful construction of liberty for us
should take the most general conditions of modernity as given. This
was the lesson of Benjamin Constant’s marvelous speech, given in 1819,
The Liberty of the Ancients compared with that of the Moderns,20 in
which he pointed out that whatever the merits for an ancient republic
of a concept of liberty linked to republican virtue, they were essen-
tially limited to the conditions of an ancient republic, and only disas-
ter could follow, as indeed it had followed in France, from trying to
apply such an ideal to a modern commercial society.
Of course there is room for much argument about what the condi-
tions of modernity are, what forms a modern society can intelligibly take,
and so on: but that is as it should be, for that is the substance of much
signiWcant political argument. But granted in a general sense the condi-
tions of modernity as shaping the construction of our idea of liberty, there
will be a variety of consequences. For instance, I mentioned earlier a
range of things that can count as coercive restrictions on an agent’s do-
ing what he wants, intentional activities of others that can count as lim-
iting freedom. In the context of modernity, it will be clear why in general
factor (C) above, the eVects of competition in something like a zero-sum
From Freedom to Liberty:
21
The Construction of a
Political Value
game, will not count, because competition is integral to the social sys-
tem.
This is not to deny that there can be political arguments to the eVect
that certain kinds of competition are so damaging to the general inter-
est, and perhaps to the interests of losers, that they need to be controlled:
it is merely that these are not per se arguments based on the losers’ lib-
erty. Rather similarly, factor (D) above—by-products of another enter-
prise not aimed at the person in question—do not presumptively count
as limiting that person’s liberty, though there are many special cases in
which they do so. This is because they are a ubiquitous phenomenon
essentially connected with the society’s central activities. Factor (E), on
the other hand, arrangements which structurally limit the opportunities
of some class of citizens, are more likely to count, and complaints about
power structures which have such eVects are readily understood as com-
plaints in liberty. This is because we have a better and typically modern
understanding of such power structures, and, we hope, some achievable
means of changing the situation.
Granted that a person’s complaint that he has sustained a cost of lib-
erty lies within such limits implicit in the conditions of modernity, how-
ever exactly we understand them; granted the wider condition (i), that
the restriction is not one that would be necessary under any state; and
granted of course that it is factually correct, that is to say that his desires
really are frustrated or limited by the activities about which he is com-
plaining; then we should accept the idea that emerged from the earlier
arguments, that if someone feels that some action or arrangement im-
poses on him a cost in liberty, then it does indeed do so. This does not
mean, of course, that the action or arrangement should not be allowed:
the cost in his liberty is very often outweighed by the values served by
the action or arrangement. Moreover, it need not justify or call for any
compensation. He need not have a claim in liberty in any court. But a
cost in liberty is still what it is, even if he quite properly has to carry the
cost himself.
A construction of liberty on these lines might be thought to spread
the idea of a cost in liberty too wide. It means that, within certain limits,
anyone with a grievance or who is frustrated by others’ actions can ap-
propriately complain about restrictions on his liberty. If “appropriately”
means that it is semantically, conceptually, indeed psychologically, in-
Philosophy & Public AVairs
22
telligible that he should do so, that is right. If it means that it is necessar-
ily useful, helpful, to be taken seriously as a contribution to political de-
bate, and not a waste of everyone’s time, it is not right. The point is that
these latter considerations are in the broadest sense political consider-
ations, and that is the point of the construction.
The conditions I have suggested for complaints of the loss of liberty
might be expressed in terms of “realism.” A form of liberty that could not
be oVered by any state is an entirely unrealistic basis of objection, and
the limitation to the conditions of modernity implies a further step to-
wards a realistic political position or claim, which can be taken seriously.
It may be said that there are two diVerent questions here, which this ap-
proach runs together: whether it is true that someone has sustained a
cost in liberty and whether it is sensible, useful, reasonable, or sane to
complain about it. These ideas are indeed not the same. It is not a reason
for supposing that there has been no loss of liberty, that it is not politi-
cally prudent to say that there has been: the loss of liberty lies in the
good sense attached to the resentment, not in the good sense or other-
wise of expressing it. However, what it is reasonable to count as some-
thing that it is sensible for someone to resent is a matter of one’s overall
view of the political world, and so, while the two ideas are certainly dis-
tinct, there is an extensive area in which they overlap, and a properly
political conception of liberty acknowledges this. Resentment about the
loss of liberty, like resentment about anything else, implies the thought
of an alternative world in which that loss does not occur, and just be-
cause liberty is a political value, the distance of that possible world from
the actual world must be measured in terms of political considerations
of relevance and practical intelligibility. The world of the anarchists is
too far away—too far away from anything—to ground complaints in lib-
erty at all. Many complaints that Xy in the face of modernity equally do
not even cross the threshold of oVering a serious political consideration.
It is also true, of course, that even if “Utopian politics” is a contradic-
tion in terms, “Utopian political thought” is not, and someone may make
a case for taking seriously complaints in liberty that would not get a hear-
ing in everyday political activity. He may show that some dimension of
resentment is more sensible than conventional opinion supposes; or he
may, just as eVectively or more so, claim that whether it is what people
call “sensible” is not the point. The aim, he may rightly say, is to change
the world, and his elevation of his or others’ resentment into a complaint
From Freedom to Liberty:
23
The Construction of a
Political Value
about liberty may indeed succeed in making it into a complaint about
liberty.
What we should be arguing about with such a complainant, if it is worth
arguing with him at all, is whether it is in the least sensible for him to
expect that a desire of that kind should not be frustrated; whether his
conception of a social world in which it would not be frustrated is not a
fantasy, either in general or in relation to historical circumstances in
which he necessarily Wnds himself; whether, on reXection, he does not
identify more deeply with the considerations that justify the coercion
than with his original desire. These are the materials of political persua-
sion, in the broadest sense, and this is what we should be engaged in. A
major aim of constructing liberty in the way I have suggested is that it
should leave space in which these arguments can take place.
There is a further and benevolent consequence. He may indeed per-
suade us our sense of what is “realistic” will change, and with it, the di-
mensions of liberty. But if, on the other hand, our persuasions succeed,
he will cease to feel the frustration. His resentment will go away. He may
come to identify fully with the grounds of coercion in such a case; he
may cease to desire what he originally desired; in any case he will not
care any more that he cannot have what he desires. If this happens, then,
on the construction I am oVering, there will be no frustrated desire (and
not for reasons that fail the Critical Theory test); so his liberty will no
longer be restricted, and there will no longer be a cost in liberty.
IX. THE VALUE OF LIBERTY
Someone may ask why liberty is a value at all. This might mean, why is
liberty in any of the various constructions that have been given of it in
diVerent historical circumstances a value at all? Why should human be-
ings in general be concerned with some value of that form? I do not know
that I can answer that question, beyond suggesting a set of questions to
put in its place: What view would one have to take of one’s desires and
projects and other values if there were never even a question of its being
something to be resented and resisted if others aimed to frustrate them?
What view would one have to take of those others, in particular of a po-
litical authority, for that question never to arise?
A better question might be: why is liberty the special value it is for us?
Why does it play the particular role that it does in our political thought
Philosophy & Public AVairs
24
and aspirations? In particular, why is it so important? That question must
be directed to liberty under the kind of construction that is appropriate
to our circumstances, and one answer to it, an “internal” answer, will lie
in inviting the questioner to think about liberty in terms of those cir-
cumstances and in relation to other political values and beliefs that be-
long to our world. We invite him to acknowledge who and where he is,
and ask him what alternative he has to this structure of ideas and at what
Utopian distance the alternative, and the political arrangements that
might go with it, lie from the world in which we and he all live. We can
argue about the merits of those other arrangements, and this will be,
once more, a political argument, one that works with the materials which,
in this condition, he and we can use.
This is Wne, so far as it goes. Yet there is something unsatisfactory about
saying just this much. On the one hand, we are insisting that if we are to
think realistically about political values, we must do so, so to speak, from
here. At the same time, indeed in making this very statement, we seem to
acknowledge that “here” is just one place among others: that we can con-
sider the modern condition, our condition, to some extent from the out-
side and compare it with others. If we can do that, then we should be
able to say rather more than we have said about this modern construc-
tion of liberty, and its value, as compared with others. This touches on a
familiar point which I mentioned very brieXy before. One of the most
prominent characteristics of modernity is its historical self-conscious-
ness, and that carries with it certain demands on how we understand
ourselves. What we have said to this questioner so far does not seem to
do enough to meet those demands. Can we do any more?
Perhaps we can. In conclusion, I shall try to sketch in the barest out-
line some more that we might say. To do so, I must go back for a last time
to primitive freedom and its being, as I put it, a “proto-political” con-
cept. I argued that primitive freedom is not itself a political value (and
perhaps not a value of any kind). This is because the notion of a political
value implies an impartial standpoint to determine the priority of diVer-
ent agents’ desires, a standpoint which is not given simply by the idea of
each person’s desires. That standpoint must be that of an authority with
a power to enforce. Once we have such an authority, I said, the question
of freedom and coercion arises again, now in relation to the coercion
which the authority exerts. If this is not to be merely another contribu-
tion to conXict, the authority must have authority; and this means that
From Freedom to Liberty:
25
The Construction of a
Political Value
in some terms or other, it must be acknowledged as legitimate. Let us
now say there is need for legitimate government (where this means that
it is counted or recognized as legitimate in a given society, not that we
would necessarily accept it by our standards of legitimacy).
I take it that the following is a universal truth: legitimate government
is not just coercive power. It is true, moreover, in the sense of “legiti-
macy” I am using, in which the idea is relativized to local understand-
ings: everyone everywhere where there is such a thing as government
recognizes some distinction between legitimate government and a mere
conspiracy of eVective coercion, even if many people have lived and do
live under such a conspiracy or in a state which is not much more. For
there to be legitimate government, there must be a legitimation story,
which explains why state power can be used to coerce some people rather
than others and to allow people to restrict other people’s freedom in some
ways rather than others. Moreover, this story is supposed to legitimate
the arrangements to each citizen, that is to say, to each person from whom
the state expects allegiance; though there may be other people within
the state, slaves or captives, who are nakedly the objects of coercion and
for whom there is no such legitimation story.21
The fact that everywhere there is a legitimation story to be told to each
citizen does not imply, of course, that in terms of the story there is some
presumption that citizens should be treated equally. Most such stories
in the past have delivered various forms of inequality and hierarchy, with
corresponding constraints on the activities of some citizens in relation
to other citizens and to the state itself. The fact that there is a legitima-
tion story to be told is indeed enough to distinguish these societies as
examples of legitimate government, in contrast to mere successful ex-
amples of banditry. The signiWcant point for us, however, and for our
construction of liberty and the value we attach to it, is that we do not
believe these stories, and it is a notable feature of modernity that we do
not. I do not mean merely that we do not accept the stories as legitimat-
ing stories for us. I mean that to a considerable degree we regard the
Philosophy & Public AVairs
26
content of these stories, in particular those that involve religious or other
transcendental justiWcations, as simply untrue. It follows—or would fol-
low with much further argument—that in telling our own legitimation
story we start, in a sense, with less. In interpreting and distributing lib-
erty we allow each citizen a stronger presumption in favor of what he or
she certainly wants, to carry out his or her own desires.
Of course the presumptions in favor of equal and extensive liberty in
modern societies are intimately connected with the central activities of
those societies, in particular their forms of economic organization. This
is an historical platitude, but by itself it will not help our questioner who
wanted to hear more of why we value liberty as we do. Something on the
lines of the absurdly rough sketch I just outlined can perhaps give him
more. The sketch indeed connects our construction of liberty, and the
value we give it under that construction, with the condition of moder-
nity, but it oVers more than the consideration (which is in itself a per-
fectly sound consideration) that this is our condition. It connects our
ideas of liberty with a universal truth, that everywhere legitimacy requires
more than mere coercion, and it adds to this the conviction that under
the conditions of modernity, whatever else may be worse, we at any rate
have a better grasp on the truth. I do not mean on the truth about lib-
erty—in relation to this questioner, that would be marching on the spot.
Rather, we have a grasp on truths that destroy those fantasies that once
provided the fabric of pre-modern legitimation stories.
If that account could be made good, it would yield the conclusion that
modern societies, or some of them, are rightly more concerned with lib-
erty and aim to deliver more of it than did earlier societies. Of course, the
liberty they aim to deliver is understood or constructed in terms appro-
priate to modernity, but that does not make their promise merely circu-
lar or empty. It is backed by the idea that whatever else they may have
taken away or made impossible, modern societies can oVer and perhaps
sustain a construction of liberty in which the constraints on it are fewer
and, above all, more truthfully motivated than in most societies of the
past.
