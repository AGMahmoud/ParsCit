1. John Rawls has said in Political Liberalism (New York: Columbia University Press, 1993),
p. xvi, “In [A] Theory [of Justice] a moral conception of justice general in scope is not distin-
guished from a strictly political theory of justice,” and the aim of the later book is to give
such a political theory. But the later account still represents the political conception as
itself a moral conception, although one directed to a special subject matter (p. 11). It is
signiWcant how far moral conceptions still structure the theory: the solution to the central
problem of the stability of a just society, for instance, is worked out in terms of the moral
powers of its citizens.
2. The somewhat Manichean distinction between “principle” and “policy,” where the
latter is understood in consequentialist terms, is sometimes understood as roughly paral-
lel to that in the United States between the Supreme Court and the Congress. To the ex-
tremely limited extent that this is true, it can be regarded as a special product of history as
well as something of a misfortune.

8. Hobbes famously argued that such things do not reduce freedom, but merely raise
the cost of a particular course of action. Although it suited Hobbes’s purpose to treat this as
a consideration relevant to the theory of political freedom, it is better understood in the
context of an account of voluntary action: the fact that an action is coerced in this sense
does not mean, standardly, that it fails to be a fully intentional action.
9. As is argued by Raymond Geuss in History and Illusion in Politics (Cambridge: Cam-
bridge University Press, 2001), pp. 96–98.
10. Quentin Skinner (“The Paradoxes of Political Liberty,” in S. M. McMurrin, ed., Tan-
ner Lectures on Human Values VII [Salt Lake City: University of Utah Press, 1986]) points
out that this is not a paradox in the context of positive liberty theory. Indeed. But since it
is a paradox, that is a problem for the theory.
11. More irresponsibly than the tradition of republican liberty, which, as Skinner has
shown (“The Paradoxes of Political Liberty”), is something diVerent. It is not surprising,
however, that it should be suspect for some of the same reasons: see note 18.

13. Geuss (History and Illusion in Politics) refers to this remark, p. 104, 108–9, but he
does not discuss it in relation to the argument mentioned above at note 9.
14. The following arguments suggest that it is not a value of any kind, but I shall not take
up that question here.
15. Ronald Dworkin, Sovereign Virtue (Cambridge, Mass: Harvard University Press, 2000),
ch. 3. It is fair to say that Dworkin’s disinclination to accept conXicts between liberty and
equality depends as much on his account of equality as on his account of liberty. I am
grateful to Dworkin for many discussions of this subject, which have done much to shape
the present discussion.
16. The U.S. Supreme Court itself implicitly accepts this when it engages in “balancing.”
An illustration is the “undue burden” test for the constitutionality of regulations on abor-
tion: Planned Parenthood v. Casey, 505 US 833 (1992). (I am indebted here and elsewhere to
Robert Post.)
17. The idea that resentment is grounded in thoughts about right is encouraged by the
familiar phenomenon of back-formation, in which someone who is merely disadvantaged
18. Here Rousseau’s outlook coincides with the tradition of republican virtue (see note 11
above). The idea that in a virtuous ancient republic the constraint to engage in public ser-
vice did not involve a cost in liberty, if it implies anything about citizens’ actual reactions,
should surely be treated with some skepticism. If it says, rather, that because an ideally
rational citizen would not react in that way, those reactions do not count, republican lib-
erty will certainly court many of the same dangers as “positive liberty.”
19. It is not suggested that this is a suVicient account of a Critical Theory test. Obviously,
beliefs and states of desire can be quite properly the causal product of regimes to which
people have been exposed or even subjected: educational regimes, for instance. Further
questions are involved: partly, about the kinds of belief in question, and what they, or the
presence or absence of certain desires, are supposed to justify; partly, about the attitude
that the people would have to the beliefs or desires if they knew how they came about. I
discuss some of the problems involved in Telling and Truthfulness (Princeton: Princeton
University Press, forthcoming.)

21. I have claimed in Shame and Necessity (Berkeley: University of California Press, 1993),
ch. 5, that this was the situation with slavery in the ancient world, which was typically re-
garded as necessary rather than just: the Helots in Sparta were indeed explicitly under-
stood to be enemies in captivity. The racist justiWcations of modern slavery were presum-
ably meant in some sense to legitimate the institution; I am less clear how far they were
meant to legitimate it to the slaves.
