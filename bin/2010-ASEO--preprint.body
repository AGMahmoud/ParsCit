ABSTRACT
This article introduces and discusses the concept of academic 
search engine optimization (ASEO). Based on three recently 
conducted studies, guidelines are provided on how to optimize 
scholarly literature for academic search engines in general and 
for Google Scholar in particular. In addition, we briefly discuss 
the risk of researchers’ illegitimately ‘over-optimizing’ their 
articles.

1. INTRODUCTION
Researchers should have an interest in ensuring that their articles 
are indexed by academic search engines1 such as Google Scholar, 
IEEE Xplore, PubMed, and SciPlore.org, which greatly improves 
their ability to make their articles available to the academic 
community. Not only should authors take an interest in seeing 
that their articles are indexed, they also should be interesting in 
where the articles are displayed in the results list. Like any other 
type of ranked search results, articles displayed in top positions 
are more likely to be read.
This article presents the concept of academic search engine 
optimization (ASEO) to optimize scholarly literature for 
academic search engines. The first part of the article covers 
related work that has been done mostly in the field of general 
search engine optimization for Web pages. The second part 
defines ASEO and compares it to search engine optimization for 
Web pages. The third part provides an overview of ranking 
algorithms of academic search engines in general, followed by an 
overview of Google Scholar’s ranking algorithm. Finally, 
guidelines are provided on how authors can optimize their 
articles for academic search engines. This article does not cover 
how publishers or providers of academic repositories can 
optimize their Web sites and repositories for academic search 
engines. The guidelines are based on three studies we have 
recently conducted [1-3] and on our experience in developing the 
academic search engine Sci Plore.org.
1 In this article we do not distinguish between ‘academic 
databases’ and ‘academic search engines’; the latter term is 
used as synonym for both.
2. RELATED WORK
On the Web, search engine optimization (SEO) for Web sites is a 
common procedure. SEO involves creating or modifying a Web 
site in a way that makes it ‘easier for search engines to both 
crawl and index [its] content’ [4]. There exists a huge community 
that discusses the latest trends in SEO and provides advice for 
Webmasters in forums, blogs, and newsgroups.2 Even research 
articles and books exist on the subject of SEO [5-10]. When SEO 
began, many expressed their concerns that it would promote 
spam and tweaking, and, indeed, search-engine spam is a serious 
issue [11-26]. Today, however, SEO is a common and widely 
accepted procedure and overall, search engines manage to 
identify spam quite well. Probably the strongest argument for 
SEO is the fact that search engines themselves publish guidelines 
on how to optimize Web sites for search engines [4, 27]. But 
similar information on optimizing scholarly literature for 
academic search engines does not exist, to our knowledge.3
2.1 Introduction to Academic Search Engine 
Optimization (ASEO)
Based on the definition of search engine optimization for Web 
pages (SEO), we define academic search engine optimization 
(ASEO) as follows:
Academic search engine optimization (ASEO) is the creation, 
publication, and modification of scholarly literature in a 
way that makes it easier for academic search engines to both 
crawl it and index it.
ASEO differs from SEO in four significant respects. First, for 
Web search, Google is the market leader in most (Western) 
countries [28]. This means that for Webmasters (focusing on 
Western Internet users), it is generally sufficient to optimize their 
Web sites for Google. In contrast, no such market leader exists

to get their articles indexed by Google Scholar and ranked well 
[35]. However, this information is superficial in comparison to 
other SEO articles, and the information is not aimed at authors.
for searching academic articles, and researchers would need to 
optimize their articles for several academic search engines. If 
these search engines are based on different crawling and ranking 
methods, optimization can become complicated.
Second, Webmasters usually do not need to worry about whether 
their site is indexed by a search engine: as long as any Web page 
is linked to an already indexed page, it will be crawled and 
indexed by Web search engines at some point. The situation is 
different in academia, where only a fraction of all published 
material is available on the Web and accessible to Web-based 
academic search engines such as CiteSeer. Most academic 
articles are stored in publishers’ databases; they are part of the 
‘academic invisible web,’ [29] and (academic) search engines 
usually cannot access and index these articles. A few academic 
search engines, such as Scirus and Google Scholar, cooperate 
with publishers, but still they do not cover all existing articles 
[30-32]. Researchers therefore need to think seriously about how 
to get their articles indexed by academic search engines.
Third, Webmasters can alter their pages by adding or replacing 
words and links, deleting pages, offering multiple versions with 
slight variations, and so on; in this way they can test new 
methods and adapt to changes in ranking algorithms. Scholarly 
authors can hardly do so: once an article is published, it is 
difficult and sometimes impossible to alter it. Therefore, ASEO 
needs to be performed particularly carefully.
Finally, Web search engines usually index all text on a Web site, 
or at least the majority of it. In contrast, some academic search 
engines do not index a document’s full text but instead index 
only the title and abstract. This means that for some academic 
search engines authors need to focus on the article’s title and 
abstract, but in other cases they still have to consider the full text 
for other search engines.
2.2 An Overview of Academic Search 
(VgiVeH OD VkiVQAlgRJ ❑hO
The basic concept of keyword-based searching is the same for all 
major (academic) search engines. Users search for a search term 
in a certain document field (e.g., title, abstract, body text), or in 
all fields, and all documents containing the search term are listed 
on the results page. Academic search engines use different 
ranking algorithms to determine in which position the results are 
displayed. Some let the user choose one factor on which to rank 
the results (common ranking factors are publication date, citation 
count, author or journal name and reputation, and relevance of 
the document); others combine the ranking factors into one 
algorithm, and, more often than not, the user has no influence on 
the factor’s weighting.
The relevance of a document is basically a function of how often 
the search term occurs in that document and in which part of the 
document it occurs. Generally speaking, the more often a search 
term occurs in the document, and the more important the 
document field is in which the term occurs, the more relevant the 
document is considered4. This means that an occurrence in the
4 Some algorithms, such as the BM25(f ), saturate when a word 
occurs often in the text [36].
title is weighted more heavily than an occurrence in the abstract, 
which carries more weight than an occurrence in a (sub)heading, 
than in the body text, and so on. Possible document fields that 
may be weighted differently by academic search engines are:5
•	Title
•	Author names
•	Abstract
•	(Sub)headings
•	Author keywords
•	Body text
•	Tables and figures
•	Publication name (name of journal, conference, 
proceedings, book, etc.)
•	User keywords (Social tags)
•	Social annotations
•	Description
•	Filename
•	URI
The metadata of electronic files are especially important for 
academic search engines crawling the Web. When a search 
engine finds a PDF on the Web, it does not know whether this 
PDF represents an academic article, or which one it belongs to; 
therefore, the PDF must be identified, and one way to do this is 
by extracting the author and title. This can be done by analyzing 
the full text of the document or the metadata of the PDF.
It is also important to note that text in figures and tables usually 
is indexed only if it is embedded as real text or within a vector 
graphic. If text is embedded as a raster graphic (e.g., *.bmp, 
*.png, *.gif, *.tif, *.jpg), most, if not all, search engines will not 
index the text (see Figures 1 and 2 for an illustration of 
differences between vector and raster/bitmap graphics).6 To our 
knowledge, none of the major academic search engines currently 
considers synonyms. This means that a document containing only 
the term ‘academic search engine’ would not be found via a 
search for ‘scientific paper search engine’ or ‘academic 
database.’ What most academic search engines do is stemming: 
words are reduced to their stems (e.g., ‘analysed’ and ‘analysing’ 
would be reduced to ‘analyse’).
2.3 *RR��OHchRlDKRODVkiVg❑ADRri ❑hm
Google Scholar is one of those search engines that combine 
several factors into one ranking algorithm. The most important 
factors are relevance, citation count, author name(s), and name of 
publication.7
5 Some of the data could be retrieved from the document full 
text, other from the metadata (of electronic files)
6 Theoretically search engines could index the text in 
raster/bitmap graphics, but they would have to apply optical 
character recognition (OCR). To our knowledge, no search 
engine currently does this, although some are using OCR to 
index complete scans of scholarly literature.
7 Google Scholar offers different search functions. For instance, it 
is possible to search for ‘related articles’ and ‘recent articles.’ 
In this article we focus on the normal ranking algorithm, which 
is applied for the standard keyword search.
2.3.1 Relevance
Google Scholar focuses strongly on document titles. Documents 
containing the search term in the title are likely to be positioned 
near the top of the results list. Google Scholar also seems to 
consider the length of a title: In a search for the term ‘SEO,’ a 
document titled ‘SEO: An Overview’ would be ranked higher 
than one titled ‘Search Engine Optimization (SEO): A Literature 
Survey of the Current State of the Art.’
Although Google Scholar indexes entire documents, the total 
search term count in the document has little or no impact. In a 
search for ‘recommender systems,’ a document containing fifty 
instances of this term would not necessarily be ranked higher 
than a document containing only ten instances.
Figure 1: Example of a Vector Graphic
Like other search engines, Google Scholar does not index text in 
figures and tables inserted as raster/bitmap graphics, but it does 
index text in vector graphics. It is also known that neither 
synonyms nor PDF metadata are considered.
2.3.2 Citation Counts
Citation counts play a major role in Google Scholar’s ranking 
algorithm, as illustrated in Figure 3, which shows the mean 
citation count for each position in Google Scholar.8 It is clear 
that, on average, articles in the top positions have significantly 
more citations than articles in the lowest positions. This means 
that to achieve a good ranking in Google Scholar, many citations 
are essential. Google Scholar seems not to differentiate between 
self-citations and citations by third parties.
8 On average, articles at position 1 had 834 citations, articles at 
position 2 had 552, articles at position 3 had 426, and articles 
at position 1000 had fifty-three. The study was based on 
1,032,766 results produced by 1050 search queries in 
November 2008. For more detail see [1].
Figure 2: Example of a Bitmap Graphic
2.3.3 Author and Publication Name
If the search query includes an author or publication name, a 
document in which either appears is likely to be ranked high. For 
instance, seventy-four of the top 100 results of a search for 
‘arteriosclerosis and thrombosis cure&apos; we re arti d es about vari ous 
(medical) topics from the journal Arteriosclerosis, Thrombosis, 
and V ascul ar Bi of ogy, many of whi ch di d not i nd ude the search 
term either in the title or in the full text [2].
Figure 3: Mean Citation Count per Position8
2.3.4 Other factors
Google Scholar’s standard search does not consider publication 
dates. However, Google Scholar offers a special search function 
for ‘recent articles,’ which limits results to articles published 
within the past five years. Furthermore, Google Scholar claims to 
consider both publication and author reputation [33]. However, 
we could not research the influence of these factors because of a 
lack of data, and therefore we do not consider them here.
2.3. 5 Sources Indexed by Google Scholar
Bert van Heerde, a professional in the field of SEO, uses the 
term ‘invitation based search engine’ to describe Google Scholar: 
Only articles from trusted sources and articles that are ‘invited’ 
(cited) by articles already indexed are included in the database 
[34]. ‘Trusted sources,’ in this case, are publishers that cooperate 
directly with Google Scholar, as well as publishers and 
Webmasters who have requested that Google Scholar crawl their 
databases and Web sites.9
Once an article is included in Google Scholar’s database, Google 
Scholar searches the Web for corresponding PDF files, even if a 
trusted publisher has already provided the full text. 10 It makes no 
difference on which site the PDF is published; for instance, 
Google Scholar has indexed PDF files of our articles from the 
publisher’s site, our university’s site, our private home pages, 
and SciPlore.org. PDFs found on the Web are linked directly on 
Google Scholar’s results pages, in addition to the link to the 
publisher’s full text (see Figure 4 for an illustrative example).
Figure 4: Linking database entries with external PDFs
If different PDF files of an article exist, Google Scholar groups 
them to improve the article’s ranking [35]. For instance, if a 
preprint version of an article is available on the author’s Web 
page and the final version is available on the publisher’s site, 
Google indexes both as one version. If the two versions contain 
different words, Google Scholar associates all contained words 
with the article. This is an interesting feature that we will 
discuss in more detail in the next section.
3. OPTIMIZING SCHOLARLY 
LITERATURE FOR GOOGLE SCHOLAR 
AND OTHER ACADEMIC SEARCH 
ENGINES
3.1 Preparation
In the beginning it is necessary to think about the most important 
words that are relevant to the article. It is not possible to 
optimize one document for dozens of keywords, so it is better to 
choose a few. There are tools that help in selecting the right 
keywords, such as Google Trends, Google Insights, Google 
Adwords keyword tool, Google Search–based keyword tool, and 
Spacky.11
9 Visit http://www.google.com/support/scholar/bin/request.py to 
ask Google Scholar to crawl your Web site containing scholarly 
articles.
10 Google Scholar also indexes other file types, such as 
PostScript (*.ps), Microsoft Word (*.doc), and MS PowerPoint 
(*.ppt). Here we focus on PDF, which is the most common 
format for scientific articles.
11 Google Trends http://www.google.com/trends
Google Insights http://www.google.com/insights/search/ 
It might be wise not to select those keywords that are most 
popular. It is usually a good idea to query the common academic 
search engines using each proposed keyword; if the search 
already returns hundreds of documents, it may be better to 
choose another keyword with less competition. 12
3.2 Writing Your Article
Once the keywords are chosen, they need to be mentioned in the 
right places: in the title, and as often as possible in the abstract 
and the body of the text (but, of course, not so often as to annoy 
readers). Although in general titles should be fairly short, we 
suggest choosing a longer title if there are many relevant 
keywords.
Synonyms of important keywords should also be mentioned a few 
times in the body of the text, so that the article may be found by 
someone who does not know the most common terminology used 
in the research field. If possible, synonyms should also be 
mentioned in the abstract, particularly because some academic 
search engines do not index the document’s full text.
Be consistent in spelling people’s names, taking special care 
with names that contain special characters. If names are used 
inconsistently, search engines may not be able to identify articles 
or citations correctly; as a consequence, citations may be 
assigned incorrectly, and articles will not be as highly ranked as 
they could be. For instance, Jöran, Joeran, and Joran are all 
correct spellings of the same name (given different transcription 
rules), but Google Scholar sees them as three different names.
The article should use a common scientific layout and structure, 
including standard sections: introduction, related work, results, 
and so on. A common scientific layout and structure will help 
Web-based academic search engines to identify an article as 
scientific.
Academic search engines, and especially Google Scholar, assign 
significant weight to citation counts. Citations influence whether 
articles are indexed at al l, and they also influence the ranking of 
articles. We do not want to encourage readers to build ‘citation 
circles,’ or to take any other unethical action. But any published 
articles you have read that relate to your current research paper 
should be cited. When referencing your own published work, it is 
important to include a link where that work can be downloaded. 
This helps readers to find your article and helps academic search 
engines to index the referenced article’s full text. Of course, this 
can also be done for other articles that have well-known (i.e., 
stable and possibly canonical) download locations.
3.3 Preparing for Publication
Text in figures and tables should be machine readable (i.e., 
vector graphics containing font-based text should be used instead
Google Adwords 
https://adwords.google.com/select/KeywordToolExternal; 
Google keyword tool, http://google.com/sktool/
Spacky, http://www.spacky.com
12 For example, keywords such as ‘Web’ and ‘HTML’ may be of 
limited use because there are too many papers published in that 
space, in which case it makes more sense to narrow the scope 
and choose better-differentiated keywords.
of rasterized images) so that it can easily be indexed by academic 
search engines. Vector graphics also look more professional, and 
are more user friendly, than raster/bitmap graphics. Graphics 
stored as JPEG, BMP, GIF, TIFF, or PNG files are not vector 
graphics.
When documents are converted to PDF, all metadata should be 
correct (especially author and title). Some search engines use 
PDF metadata to identify the file or to display information about 
the article on the search results page. It may also be beneficial to 
give a meaningful file name to each article.
3.4 Publishing
As part of the optimization process, authors should consider the 
journal’s or publisher’s policies. Open-access articles usually 
receive more citations than articles accessible only by purchase 
or subscription; and, obviously, only articles that are available on 
the Web can be indexed by Web-based academic search engines. 
Accordingly, when selecting a journal or publisher for 
submission, authors should favor those that cooperate with 
Google Scholar and other academic search engines, since the 
article will potentially obtain more readers and receive more 
citations. 13 If a journal does not publish online, authors should 
favor publishers who at least allow authors to put their articles 
on their or their institutions’ home pages.
3.5 Follow-Up
There are three ways to optimize articles for academic search 
engines after publication.
The first is to publish the article on the author’s home page, so 
that Web-based academic search engines can find and index it 
even if the journal or publisher does not publish the article 
online. An author who does not have a Web page might post 
articles on an institutional Web page or upload it to a site such as 
Sciplore.org, which offers researchers a personal publications 
home page that is regularly crawled by Google Scholar (and, of 
course, by SciPlore Search). However, it is important to 
determine that posting or uploading the article does not 
constitute a violation of the author’s agreement with the 
publisher.
Second, an article that includes outdated words might be 
replaced by either updating the existing article or publishing a 
new version on the author’s home page. Google Scholar, at least, 
considers all versions of an article available on the Web. We 
consider this a good way of making older articles easier to find. 
However, this practice may also violate your publisher’s 
copyright policy, and it may also be considered misbehavior by 
other researchers. It could also be a risky strategy: at some point 
in the future, search engines may come to classify this practice as 
spamming. In any case, updated articles should be clearly labeled 
as such, so that readers are aware that they are reading a 
modified version.
Third, it is important to create meaningful parent Web pages for 
PDF files. This means that Web pages that link to the PDF file 
should mention the most important keywords and the PDFs
13 The main criteria for selecting a publisher or journal, of 
course, should still be its reputation and its general suitability 
for the paper. The policy is to be seen as an additional factor.
metadata (title, author, and abstract). We do not know whether 
any academic search engines are considering these data yet, but 
normal search engines do consider them, and it seems only a 
matter of time before academic search engines do, too.
4. DISCUSSION
As was true in the beginning for classic SEO, there are some 
reservations about ASEO in the academic community. When we 
submitted our study about Google Scholar’s ranking algorithm 
[2] to a conference, it was rejected. One reviewer provided the 
following feedback:
I’m not a big fan of this area of research [...]. I know it’s in 
the call for papers, but I think that’s a mistake.
A second reviewer wrote,
[This] paper seems to encourage scientific paper authors to 
learn Google scholar’s ranking method and write papers 
accordingly to boost ranking [which is not] acceptable to 
scientific communities which are supposed to advocate true 
technical quality/impact instead of ranking.
ASEO should not be seen as a guide on how to cheat academic 
search engines. Rather, it is about helping academic search 
engines to understand the content of research papers and, thus, 
about how to make this content more widely and easily available. 
Certainly, we can anticipate that some researchers will try to 
boost their rankings in illegitimate ways. However, the same 
problem exists in regular Web searching; and eventually Web 
search engines manage to avoid spam with considerable success, 
and so will academic search engines. In the long term, ASEO 
will be beneficial for all – authors, search engines, and users of 
search engines. Therefore, we believe that academic search 
engine optimization (ASEO) should be a common procedure for 
researchers, similar to, for instance, selecting an appropriate 
journal for publication.
