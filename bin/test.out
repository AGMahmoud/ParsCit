<rawString>John Rawls has said in Political Liberalism (New York: Columbia University Press, 1993), p. xvi, “In [A] Theory [of Justice] a moral conception of justice general in scope is not distinguished from a strictly political theory of justice,” and the aim of the later book is to give such a political theory. But the later account still represents the political conception as itself a moral conception, although one directed to a special subject matter (p. 11). It is signiWcant how far moral conceptions still structure the theory: the solution to the central problem of the stability of a just society, for instance, is worked out in terms of the moral powers of its citizens.</rawString>

<rawString>Quentin Skinner (“The Paradoxes of Political Liberty,” in S. M. McMurrin, ed., Tanner Lectures on Human Values VII [Salt Lake City: University of Utah Press, 1986]) points out that this is not a paradox in the context of positive liberty theory. Indeed. But since it is a paradox, that is a problem for the theory.</rawString>

<rawString>Ronald Dworkin, Sovereign Virtue (Cambridge, Mass: Harvard University Press, 2000), ch. 3. It is fair to say that Dworkin’s disinclination to accept conXicts between liberty and equality depends as much on his account of equality as on his account of liberty. I am grateful to Dworkin for many discussions of this subject, which have done much to shape the present discussion.</rawString>

<title>Here Rousseau’s outlook coincides with the tradition of republican virtue (see note 11 above). The idea that in a virtuous ancient republic the constraint to engage in public service did not involve a cost in liberty, if it implies anything about citizens’ actual reactions, should surely be treated with some skepticism. If it says, rather, that because an ideally rational citizen would not react in that way, those reactions do not count, republican liberty will certainly court many of the same dangers as “positive liberty</title>

<title>It is not suggested that this is a suVicient account of a Critical Theory test. Obviously, beliefs and states of desire can be quite properly the causal product of regimes to which people have been exposed or even subjected: educational regimes, for instance. Further questions are involved: partly, about the kinds of belief in question, and what they, or the presence or absence of certain desires, are supposed to justify; partly, about the attitude that the people would have to the beliefs or desires if they knew how they came about.

<rawString>I have claimed in Shame and Necessity (Berkeley: University of California Press, 1993), ch. 5, that this was the situation with slavery in the ancient world, which was typically regarded as necessary rather than just: the Helots in Sparta were indeed explicitly understood to be enemies in captivity. The racist justiWcations of modern slavery were presumably meant in some sense to legitimate the institution; I am less clear how far they were meant to legitimate it to the slaves.</rawString>
