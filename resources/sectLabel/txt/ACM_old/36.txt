ABSTRACT
A neural network based clustering method for the analysis +L+ of soft handovers in 3G network is introduced. The method +L+ is highly visual and it could be utilized in explorative anal- +L+ ysis of mobile networks. In this paper, the method is used +L+ to find groups of similar mobile cell pairs in the sense of +L+ handover measurements. The groups or clusters found by +L+ the method are characterized by the rate of successful han- +L+ dovers as well as the causes of failing handover attempts. +L+ The most interesting clusters are those which represent cer- +L+ tain type of problems in handover attempts. By comparing +L+ variable histograms of a selected cluster to histograms of +L+ the whole data set an application domain expert may find +L+ some explanations on problems. Two clusters are investi- +L+ gated further and causes of failing handover attempts are +L+ discussed.

(SHO). Soft handover makes it possible to have connections +L+ on several base stations (BS) simultaneously.
In this paper, a set of measurements which can be used for +L+ soft handover decision making are analyzed and compared +L+ with other measurements in which statistics of successful- +L+ ness of handover attempts have been collected. We do not +L+ know exactly the parameters of used SHO algorithm. SHOs +L+ are investigated only on basis of data set and some general +L+ knowledge of 3G systems. Mobile cell pairs with handovers +L+ (HO) are divided in groups using clustering algorithm. Cell +L+ pairs in which SHOs are similar with each other fall in same +L+ group. Different types of SHO failures are analyzed using +L+ clustering information and distributions of measurements in +L+ each cluster.
In Section 2 the soft handover concept, the measurements +L+ and used neural network algorithm are shortly introduced. +L+ Analysis methods which have been used are described in +L+ Section 3. Preliminary results are shown and discussed in +L+ Section 4. Finally, some conclusions are drawn in the last +L+ section.
2. BACKGROUND
In this section, the basics of soft handover in 3G network +L+ is explained and the available data set is introduced. Neural +L+ network algorithm used in data clustering is also presented.
2.1 Soft handover
Soft handover is a state of MS being connected to several +L+ BSs simultaneously. In GSM networks, a fixed threshold for +L+ handover from one cell to another is used. In 3G networks, +L+ each MS is connected to a network via a set of BSs called +L+ active set. Members of active set are updated on basis of +L+ measurements made by MS. The advantage of having con- +L+ nections on several BS simultaneously is realized when MS +L+ is moving towards another BS, the MS should have a con- +L+ nection at least on one BS all the time. In GSM system, the +L+ older connection has to be terminated before the new one +L+ can be setup. The connection setup phases are the most +L+ vulnerable steps in a call. The connection between MS and +L+ BS is setup in a beginning of a call or later when handover +L+ occurs. If the setup is not successful, it is useful to have an +L+ existing connection to another BS or otherwise the call will +L+ be abnormally terminated.
Handover can occur due to signal quality reasons or when +L+ the traffic capacity in a cell has reached its maximum or is +L+ approaching it. In the latter case, traffic load in the network +L+ can be distributed more uniformly by handing over some +L+ users from the most crowded cells. The above method is
330
called cell breathing. Use of cell breathing without giving +L+ the information to the analyzer increases the complexity of +L+ the analysis and can mix up a lot in the analysis process.
For a user soft handover means power saving (in uplink) +L+ and less abnormally terminated calls. For an operator lower +L+ MS transmitting powers mean less interference. When MS +L+ is in SHO, several BSs listen the same uplink channel, but +L+ all BSs have their own downlink channel. The offered diver- +L+ sity is resource consuming in downlink direction. There is +L+ a tradeoff between better QoS in mobility management and +L+ consumption of resources.
Decision of soft handover is made in mobile station by +L+ comparing the signal-to-noise ratios of active and candidate +L+ BSs Common Pilot Channel (CPICH) [2]. Members of ac- +L+ tive set are selected on basis of powers of this pilot signal [5, +L+ 12, 16] .
BSs which are not in the active set but next from it in the +L+ sense of measured quantity are in candidate set. Candidate +L+ set BSs are constantly monitored whether their offer better +L+ connection than cells in active set. Cells not in active or +L+ candidate set are monitored less frequently whether their +L+ can enter the candidate set. Cell is either added to the +L+ active set if the maximum amount of cells in the active set +L+ is not reached or cell replaces the cell which offers the lowest +L+ quality connection. Cells which are no more able to offer +L+ a connection which is good enough are removed from the +L+ active set.
Thresholds are used in adding, replacing and removing +L+ BSs from active set by BSs in candidate set to avoid ping +L+ pong effect. This means that a value of measured quantity +L+ should be with a certain threshold better than the old one +L+ for changing cells in active set. If measurement which is only +L+ slightly better (i.e. with zero threshold) is enough for chang- +L+ ing cells in sets, it is quite possible that the same change is +L+ performed in opposite direction very soon. Thus, the origi- +L+ nal update of the set was useless and resource consuming in +L+ the sense of all required signaling.
2.2 Data
Three data sets of Key Performance Indicator (KPI) level +L+ measurements related on handover events are saved. Each +L+ set consists of measurements collected during one hour. KPI +L+ is considered as an important measure to be followed. It can +L+ be a measurement by itself or it has been computed from a +L+ group of raw counters [10]. One data vector consists of prob- +L+ abilities, means, sums and counters computed over one hour +L+ of one source target cell pair. Here, source refers on cell +L+ in active set and target on another cell which is measured +L+ and possibly added in active or candidate set. Measure- +L+ ments of target cell are compared with those of source cell. +L+ Handover decisions are made in MS on basis of measured +L+ and computed base stations received signal signal-to-noise +L+ ratios (Ec/N0). For each source and target cell pair mean +L+ of signal-to-noise ratio differences is computed using
EcnoDiffMean = mean {[Ec/N0]target — [Ec/N0] source}
Mean value and number off made comparisons (EcnoDiffNum) +L+ are saved. Four bin pdfs of these measurements are also +L+ stored with bin centers in -6, -3, 0 and 3dB, correspond- +L+ ingly.
In addition to Ec/N0 measurements, averages of received +L+ pilot signal power ratios between BS pairs (av rscp ratio) +L+ have been computed and stored in database. The time and +L+ probability of being in SHO with each other have also been +L+ measured. Time of target and source cell being in SHO with +L+ each other simultaneously is counted in variable t act. Then, +L+ at least one MS is in SHO having both source and target cell +L+ in its active set. The measurement is symmetric for a switch +L+ of source and target cells. Time of target cell being in SHO +L+ with source cell is stored in t act dir. Cell total time in +L+ SHO is saved in tot time sho. It has been counted over all +L+ the targets of fixed source cell. Probability of target and +L+ source being in same active set is stored in variable p act.
Total number of SHO attempts to add target to active +L+ set is stored in SHO total att. Ratio of successful SHO at- +L+ tempts which lead to addition of target cell in active set is +L+ saved in add ratio. In addition to those above, the num- +L+ ber of SHO failures is stored in pfail total and ratios of four +L+ different failure causes are saved. Failure occurs in setup +L+ or active time phase of SHO and it is either radio channel +L+ problem or not. Probability of cell being in monitored state +L+ is also measured (p4th 5th). All the measurements used in +L+ the analysis are shortly described in Table 1.
A lot of data has been saved in data sets, but also some +L+ very important information is missing. Due to missing in- +L+ formation on cell capacities, their locations and performed +L+ manual and automatic tuning operations on network config- +L+ uration between successive data set saves, only preliminary +L+ analysis can be performed. The rest of the analysis process +L+ is described on theoretical level.
2.3 Self-Organizing Map
Self-Organizing Map (SOM) [8] is an unsupervised neu- +L+ ral network algorithm which adapts the codebook vectors +L+ of neurons so that they approximate the input data distri- +L+ bution. When the training has converged topological areas +L+ or domains corresponding to certain types of inputs can be +L+ found from the map. The topology and the size of the net- +L+ work is fixed before adaptation.
In the SOM algorithm, the codebook vectors wj of the +L+ SOM are at first initialized. Then, the following steps are +L+ repeated for each input vector x: Find the index of best- +L+ matching or nearest codebook vector using
i(x) = argminI Ix — wj I I,
in which j goes through all the neurons in the map. Next, +L+ the codebook vectors of winner neuron and its neighbors are +L+ updated using
wj (t + 1) = wj (t) + αhij (x)(x(t) — wj (t)).
Here, α is the learning rate and hij (x) is the neighborhood +L+ function centered around the winner neuron. Input sample +L+ x defines the winner neuron and the topological distance +L+ between indexes i and j defines how much the neuron is +L+ updated. Neighborhood function is typically Gaussian or +L+ bubble function i.e. function which decrease monotonically +L+ and even goes to zero when the distance increases.
In this paper, a batch version of the SOM algorithm is +L+ used. In batch SOM, all codebook vectors of the SOM are +L+ computed after the best-matching units of all input data +L+ vectors have been found. The same data set is used several +L+ times.
3. METHODS
Handover related measurement from 3G network can be +L+ analyzed using standard data mining methods [1]. In this

study, methods presented in Figure 1 are used. At first, +L+ the miner have to decide what could be interesting in this +L+ data. The analysis task has to be defined. On basis of that +L+ the first choice of variables will be done. Next, the selected +L+ variables are preprocessed, in order to be able to use them +L+ in later analysis.
In data mining tasks, variable selection and preprocessing +L+ are the most critical phases, because in this step the miner +L+ decides which variables are important and how should they +L+ be processed. The whole data mining process consists of sev- +L+ eral cycles performed repeatedly. The cycles include testing +L+ how different variable selections and preprocessing methods +L+ effect on final results. The process has inner loops in which +L+ some tasks or parameters are fixed on basis of selections +L+ made in outer loop. The inner loops are performed more +L+ frequently. Loops with more general task like the defini- +L+ tion of mining task are repeated less frequently. When the +L+ mining task is defined the analyzer should be able to decide +L+ what is (s)he looking out for.
Now, the analysis task is defined as finding groups of sim- +L+ ilarly behaving cell pairs in SHO situations. Importance of +L+ measurements can also be highlighted using proper weight- +L+ ing of variables. In addition to clustering, also other tasks +L+ for data analysis can be defined. One possibility is to try to +L+ find cells or cell pairs with anomalous behavior. Anomalies +L+ can also be found by clustering, but expert knowledge in +L+ variable selection and preprocessing steps are very impor- +L+ tant.
Using different variables, preprocessing methods and weight- +L+ ing of variables different clustering results can be found. To +L+ find out which of them is useful, interpretation of clusters is +L+ needed. This can be done using histograms or rules defined +L+ by data samples falling in clusters. The results which have +L+ been found using clustering methods should be visualized +L+ together with spatial locations to be able to understand the +L+ usefulness of results. Methods should be performed repeat- +L+ edly to analyze successive data sets under the knowledge of +L+ performed tuning operations. Thus, there is a possibility to +L+ find explanations to changing results. In this study, results +L+ of only one data set are shown, because more information +L+ on application domain is needed to be able to combine and +L+ compare successive clustering results.
3.1 Preprocessing
Different preprocessing methods have been tested. The +L+ final method was selected on basis of histograms and the +L+ clusters which were found using the selected method. At +L+ the first step, the distributions are truncated. Outliers in +L+ the selected variables were replaced by their maximum per- +L+ mitted values. Two variables, pfail total and EcnoDiffNum, +L+ were scaled using the number of performed soft handover +L+ attempts (see Table 1). Logarithms of some of the variables +L+ were taken, but finally only scaled EcnoDiffNum was prepro- +L+ cessed with logarithmic function. Sample vectors with high +L+ amount of undefined measurements were canceled. Used +L+ clustering method (see section 3.2) allows using sample vec- +L+ tors in which some variables are undefined. However, they +L+ are not so useful when the rate of undefined values increases. +L+ Here, sample vectors with 15 or more missing values in 20 +L+ variables are canceled.
In Figure 2 the histograms of the most interesting vari- +L+ ables preprocessed using selected methods are visualized. +L+ Some of the variables have quite high peaks in distributions, +L+ but due to the origin of variables no other preprocessing +L+ have been performed. For example, handover failure reasons +L+ pfail ini, pfail ini radio, pfail act radio and pfail act sum up +L+ to unity. However, pfail act is not analyzed because it is zero +L+ all the time in the first data set.

3.2 Clustering
Cluster analysis is used to divide data vectors in groups. +L+ Data vectors falling in same cluster are similar with each +L+ other. Here, clustering is performed using a two-phase +L+ method [15]. In this method, data vectors are at first used +L+ to train a Self-Organizing Map. Neurons of the SOM adapt +L+ to incoming data so that the input data can in later analysis +L+ be represented by the codebook vectors of neurons. Number +L+ of these codebook vectors is much smaller than the number +L+ of original data vectors. Thus, computational complexity of +L+ the final crisp clustering algorithm is decreased. Another +L+ advantage of using a SOM based two-phase method instead +L+ of direct clustering of data vectors is the visualization capa- +L+ bility of SOM.
In addition to preprocessing, SOM algorithm provides an- +L+ other possibility to emphasize important properties of data. +L+ Larger weights in distance computation are given to the +L+ most important properties defined by the analyzer. Smaller +L+ or even zero weight can be given to those variables which +L+ are not used in organization of the SOM i.e. in building clus- +L+ ters. However, values of them can be compared to those with +L+ larger weights using various visualization methods. Weight- +L+ ing by variable importance can also be built into SOM train- +L+ ing algorithm by utilizing learning distance metrics [7].

The codebook vectors are further clustered using k-means +L+ or some hierarchical clustering method. In this paper, Ward +L+ agglomerative clustering method has been used [4]. In the +L+ beginning of hierarchical clustering, each codebook vector +L+ is a cluster of its own. In the next step, the most similar +L+ clusters are combined and this is continued until all vectors +L+ are in same cluster. The clustering results form a tree struc- +L+ ture called dendrogram. In visualization of a dendrogram, +L+ the clusters combined in each step and the distance between +L+ them are shown. Final clustering is selected by cutting this +L+ tree at certain level. The number of clusters can be selected +L+ manually or some cluster validation index can be utilized +L+ to find the optimum. In this paper, Davies-Bouldin vali- +L+ dation index has been used [3]. Similar clustering methods +L+ have earlier been used in the analysis of both GSM and 3G +L+ network BTSs [9, 11, 13].
As a result of clustering, each data vector is represented +L+ by index of one neuron or by the codebook vector stored in +L+ that neuron. Furthermore, the neuron and the data vectors +L+ the neuron represents belong to same cluster. On basis of +L+ the clustering result, some clusters can be selected for more +L+ specific analysis. Cluster selection is usually done on basis +L+ of found higher values of some critical variables. It is pos- +L+ sible to build a system in which rules are found for clusters +L+ [14, 9] and these are used to select interesting clusters au- +L+ tomatically. Here, interesting clusters are selected manually +L+ on basis of clusterwise variable mean values and histograms.
4. RESULTS
In this section, handover measurement data is used to +L+ train a Self-Organizing Map of size 17 x 12. Then, the code- +L+ book vectors of the SOM are clustered using hierarchical +L+ Ward method. Results of clustering are described and two +L+ clusters are then selected for more specific analysis. Charac- +L+ teristics of sample vectors falling in those clusters are studied +L+ using histograms.

nearest neuron of input data vector. These variables have +L+ nonzero mask which can also be considered as a weighting +L+ factor in a search for the best-matching neuron. Rest of +L+ the variables have zero mask, which means that they can +L+ be visualized and updated using SOM algorithm, but they +L+ do not have an effect on organization of the SOM and on +L+ selection of the cluster in which the sample belongs to.
In Figure 3 all other component planes of SOM with pos- +L+ itive mask are shown, except Ec/N0 difference distributions +L+ which are shown in Figure 6. In component plane visual- +L+ ization, distributions of components (or variables) of SOM +L+ codebook vectors are shown. Component values of one code- +L+ book vector are visualized using grayscaling and their locate +L+ in the same position at each plane. For example, values of +L+ one codebook vector are shown at upper right corner in each +L+ plane.
Figure 3: Component planes of SOM with denor- +L+ malized scales. Shown variables have nonzero mask +L+ and they are not describing Ec/N0 difference distri- +L+ butions.
Some component values which were not used in SOM +L+ training (i.e. they were masked out) are shown in Figure +L+ 4. Although, they have no effect on SOM organization, they +L+ are adapted to be able to compare their distributions even +L+ with those used in organizing the SOM.
By visual comparison of variables in Figures 3 and 4, it can +L+ be seen that the total number of SHO attempts +L+ (SHO total att) and Ec/N0 difference measurements +L+ (EcnoDiffNum) is higher in upper part of the SOM. How- +L+ ever, when the latter is scaled by total number of attempts, +L+ higher rate of measurements (r EcnoDNum) is in lower part +L+ of the map. Also, the total number of failuring SHO at- +L+ tempts (pfail total) is high in upper right corner, but scal- +L+ ing this by number of attempts tells us that the failure rate +L+ (r fail) in upper right corner is quite moderate. Instead, +L+ higher failure rates exists in both lower corners i.e. in clus- +L+ ters 5 and 8 (see Figure 5).
Trained SOM codebook vectors are clustered using hier- +L+ archical Ward algorithm. The clustering result selected by +L+ Davies-Bouldin index is shown in Figure 5. Four bin Ec/N0 +L+ difference histograms are visualized on top of clustered SOM

in Figure 6. When component values of SOM (see Figures +L+ 3, 4 and 6) are compared with clustering result (see Figure +L+ 5) several types of source target pairs can be found. Most of +L+ them are behaving as expected, but some of them represent +L+ handover attempts with certain type of problems.

To find out the most interesting clusters of the SOM for +L+ further investigations, distribution of data samples on SOM +L+ is visualized. In Figure 7a hits of all samples on SOM nodes +L+ are visualized and in Figure 7b hits of samples with SHO +L+ failure rate (r fail) larger than 22% are shown. Samples are +L+ distributed all over the map, only some edge nodes have +L+ slightly larger hit rate. Lower part of the map has more hits +L+ when samples with increased failure rate are considered.

ent types of SHO failures are shown. Samples are from cell +L+ pairs in which the rate of selected type of failures is larger +L+ than 75%. However, handover initialization failures due to +L+ some other reason than radio channel resources (i.e. pfail ini +L+ type failures) are obviously more frequent than failures due +L+ to radio channel initialization problems (pfail ini radio type +L+ failures). Cell pairs with SHO failures originating mainly +L+ from these two reasons are mapped on separate clusters. +L+ All SHO failures due to radio channel initialization are in +L+ cluster 9 (see Figures 5 and 8b) and most of all other ini- +L+ tialization failures are in cluster 5 (see Figures 5 and 8a). In +L+ the following, these two clusters are studied in more detail.
In Figures 9 and 10 histograms of samples which belong +L+ to clusters 5 and 9 are shown. These histograms should +L+ be compared with histograms of whole data set which were +L+ shown in Figure 2. In histograms of cluster 5 (see Figure +L+ 9), the average received signal power ratio (av rscp ratio) is +L+ slightly lower than in general. Distributions of three largest +L+ Ec/N0 difference measurement bins are completely different +L+ than corresponding distributions from the whole data set. +L+ In cluster 5 most of the samples have about 3dB Ec/N0 dif- +L+ ference (EcnodiffPdf3.0) which means that at least this mea- +L+ surement makes successful SHOs possible and SHO should +L+ be performed. Exceptional Ec/N0 difference measurements

of this cluster can also be seen in Figure 6. All the failing +L+ cell pairs fail in initialization due to other than radio chan- +L+ nel reasons (pfail ini). Total rate of failures is very high +L+ (r fail). One reason for high rate of failures can be that all +L+ the capacity is in use.
In histograms of cluster 9 (see Figure 10), the average re- +L+ ceived power ratios are a bit higher than usual, but there are +L+ no samples with high rate of 3dB Ec/N0 differences (EcnoD- +L+ iffPdf3.0). However, in such a situation it should be possible +L+ to perform successful SHOs. The rate of initialization fail- +L+ ures in radio channels (pfail ini radio) is higher than usually, +L+ but because only a small part of samples in this cluster have +L+ above mentioned problems the total SHO failure rate is not +L+ higher than usually. The total number of samples or cell +L+ pairs with high rate of initialization failures in SHO is so +L+ small, that it is impossible to make any further inferences +L+ from these clusters. It is possible to check histograms of +L+ only those samples which fulfill the failure rate criteria, but +L+ the number of samples is anyway quite low.

5. CONCLUSIONS
In this paper, a data analysis method based on a neu- +L+ ral network has been presented. The method is utilized in +L+ data visualization and clustering. The presented method is +L+ only one possibility for finding data clusters. However, the +L+ benefits of the proposed method are the decrease in compu- +L+ tational complexity due to used two-phase clustering algo- +L+ rithm and the visualization capability of the method. Thus, +L+ it is well suitable for this kind of explorative data analysis.
It is desirable to find clusters with characteristics which
differ from one cluster to another. In the presented method, +L+ selection of variables and variable weighting factors have +L+ been used to find interesting clusters. In the preprocess- +L+ ing phase, also the number of permitted undefined measure- +L+ ment values in sample vector has an effect on found clusters. +L+ Sample vectors with high rate of missing values are not so +L+ usable and describable as samples without them. Vectors +L+ with missing values can be used in the SOM training but +L+ the benefit of using them decreases when the rate of unde- +L+ fined values increases.
In this study, histograms are used both when preprocess- +L+ ing methods are decided and when an interpretation for the +L+ found clusters are looked for. However, clusters can also be +L+ compared using other visual methods, finding limiting rules +L+ for variable values in clusters or comparing distributions of +L+ variable values in clusters using more sophisticated distribu- +L+ tion comparison measures like Kullback-Leibler divergences +L+ [6].
The results which have been obtained using all available +L+ data sets differ slightly from each other, but due to uncom- +L+ plete information on network configuration and parameter +L+ tuning, further inferences cannot be made. However, adding +L+ this information would offer interesting possibilities to con- +L+ tinue this study.
