Figure 1: A screenshot showing SearchBar running within Internet Explorer. The SearchBar (left pane) includes a hierarchical history of
recent search topics, queries, and results visited, along with the user’s notes on the current topic. The right pane is a standard Web browser,
currently showing a summary of the active SearchBar topic.
employ Active Storage strategies, SearchBar offers the 
ability to create custom-named topics. All search engine 
queries and all navigation events subsequent to a query are 
stored under the currently-selected topic. The user can 
move URLs and queries among topics by dragging and 
dropping, if desired. Since our own survey and others’ prior 
work have reported that users often return to search tasks 
after gaps of a week or more, the topical organization can 
add value by helping such users more quickly resume their 
task contexts. Users may also delete topics, queries, or 
URLs from SearchBar via a right-click context menu. 
Deletion undo is provided via a recycle bin.
30% of our survey respondents reported taking notes as a 
way to help manage multi-session investigations. However, 
since these notes are stored in files or on paper, they can be 
difficult for users to retrieve when they eventually resume 
their searches. Hence, we added a note-taking region to the 
SearchBar itself, allowing users to keep their notes where 
they will be immediately visible when users resume their 
tasks. Notes are associated with the currently-selected topic 
and are automatically saved.
Users can also press the “thumbs up” button to indicate that 
a particular page is especially relevant to the current topic. 
This associates a “thumbs up” icon with the currently 
viewed Web page’s SearchBar entry, making the page 
easier to identify and return to quickly and also elevating 
the page to the top of the that topic’s summary (see below). 
Users can select a checkbox which filters the SearchBar to 
only display items that have been rated in this manner.
SearchBar captures queries from several major search 
engines (Yahoo!, Google, and Windows Live Search) as 
well as several popular vertical search services (e.g., 
Amazon.com, Wikipedia, CNET, and CitySearch). A 
branding icon next to each query indicates the source used 
for that search. SearchBar is extensible, allowing easy 
addition of additional search sources. This enables 
SearchBar to produce a more comprehensive history than 
engine-specific query histories, since it incorporates 
searches from the variety of sources that people utilize.
Clicking on any topic’s title displays an automatically- 
generated summary in the browser window, which shows 
any notes the user has taken on that topic and lists all the
