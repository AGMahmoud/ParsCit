Performance per Page
Figure 6 summarises the mean performance of our eighteen 
participants’ eye movement behaviour in the high density 
condition. (All results of the low density condition has the 
same trend as in the high density condition) Figure 6a 
shows mean search duration per page, figure 6b shows 
mean number of gazes per page, figure 6c shows mean gaze 
duration per page and figure 6d shows the proportion of 
skipping gaze transitions in number of pages condition. 
Each bar within a page condition shows the performance on 
each page of that condition. For example, the only bar in the 
1-page condition shows performance in the 1-page 
condition, the two bars in 2-pages condition show each 
performance in page 1 and 2 and the five bars in 5-page 
condition show each performance from page 1 to page 5, 
from left to right respectively.
When we examined whether participants adopted different 
strategies in different pages in a search course, the values of 
four measures of search performance were taken from each 
page.
Because there were four participants who didn’t have data 
in all five pages in the 5-page condition, we took out these 
four participants. Then, we arbitrarily selected and removed 
another two participants from the analysis to keep the 
counterbalanced design. Therefore, in this section, the 
results were from analysing eighteen participants’ data. The 
following analyses were conducted in 2-pages and 5-pages 
condition separately.
In the 2-pages condition, every measure of four search 
performance of participants was not significantly different 
in page 1 and page2. it indicated that the search strategy did
not vary in the first and second page, when participants 
search in a 2-pages display (see Figure 6a, b, c, d, 2-pages 
condition).
In 5-pages condition, the results of a 5×2 repeated-measure 
ANOVA (page number: page 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 × density: 
high and low) showed there were main effect of page 
number and density on every measure of search 
performance our participants’ performance (see Figure 6 a, 
b, c, d, 5-pages condition). The results of search 
performance per page in the 5-pages condition are 
summarized in Table 1. In general, search performance was 
in page number 1 is different to other pages.
pairwise comparisons of page number with Bonferroni 
method in search duration, number of gazes, and proportion 
of skipping gaze transitions showed that the measures in 
page 1 were different from those in page 2 to page 5 (pair 
between page 1 and any other page was significant, p&lt;0.01 
and pair between page 2 to page 5 were not significant 
different). There was a significant difference between page 
1 and page 3 in gaze duration. Although any other pair does 
not reach significant, there was a trend for people to take 
longer gaze on page 1 than on pages 2, 3, 4, or 5. This 
indicated that participants search in the first page more 
carefully than other pages.
DISCUSSION
The results support the claim that visual search strategy is 
guided by expected information gain when people search 
results returned by an image search engine:
1. Participants were observed to adjust the duration that 
they attended to each item to the item density. When more
