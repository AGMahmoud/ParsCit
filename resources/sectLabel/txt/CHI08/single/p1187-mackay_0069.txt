bookmarks or not) used Firefox’s toolbar bookmarks for 
sites they revisit regularly but not, interestingly, for the 
multi-session tasks we were interested in (as they did not 
want to clutter their toolbar with sites that were considered 
temporary). Participants who did not use bookmarks 
tended to revisit pages by retyping URLs (often with auto 
complete) and re-searching terms. Participants also used 
other applications to help with their tasks. For example, 
several participants cut and pasted information into Word or 
Notepad to compare details and in order to store only 
relevant information.
Field Study
During the field study, 102 different browser tools and 
actions were captured (as recorded in Name in the logs, as 
seen in Table 1) which also included the way the action or 
tool was used (e.g., if a new tab was opened from the menu, 
control keys or buttons). In Table 7, we present the most 
common actions and tools as recorded in the field study 
logs. We also organized the use of tools and the actions 
used by multi-session tasks and by all other web activity. 
We present the counts and the percentage of the actions.
While the tools and actions recorded for other web 
activities tended to be higher than for multi-session tasks, 
there were fewer multi-session tasks in relation to the other 
logged web activities. Following a link was the most 
common activity logged. This count included links 
followed in the current page, links opened in a new 
window, and links opened in a new tab. Submitting a form 
commonly indicated when a participant was performing a 
search. The two most common forms submitted were to 
Google and to Google Scholar (93.55% for multi-session 
tasks) (both of which were used more often for multi- 
session tasks). Participants recorded using a number of 
different web search bars (e.g., IMDb and Wikipedia) but 
the most common was Google. Participants used cut/copy 
and paste into outside documents and into the browser itself 
in both single and multi-session tasks. Participants used the 
search within a page more often for multi-session tasks 
(53.27% vs. 46.73%) but typed in URLs less frequently for 
multi-session tasks (28.91% vs. 71.09%).
Using post-study interviews and the logs, we found similar 
results to the diary study with regard to participants using 
bookmarks. Only half of the participants said that they use 
bookmarks, and many of these participants indicated that 
they did not use bookmarks for multi-session tasks as they 
considered them too temporary and for some they did not 
want to clutter their bookmark list with transitory pages. 
Almost all of those who said that they use Firefox’s toolbar 
bookmarks reserved these for those pages that were 
frequently accessed. In the browser logs, the most common 
way that the participants opened their bookmarks was from 
the toolbar (987 of the 1441 incidences). We found support 
for the interview comments as only 15% of opening toolbar 
bookmarks were logged during multi-session tasks. Similar 
to the diary study interview comments, participants who did

web information (e.g., typing in the URL from memory, re-
searching the topic in Google, saving links, printing pages, 
coping information to a text editor, or using their history).
Task Characteristics
For Task Classification we used the information that the 
participants self-reported on their multi-session tasks. As 
such we were to compare and report results from both the 
diary study and the field study. We found that participants 
from both studies reported comparable task characteristics. 
Using this information we were able to organize the multi- 
session tasks into eight types according to common themes. 
Furthermore, we found that the sub-tasks for the multi- 
session tasks could be classified using the web tasks 
categories as defined by Kellar et al. [12].
Task Types
Although the specific goals of the tasks recorded (235 tasks 
total from both studies) varied we were able to group the 
tasks using their task title and description into eight general 
types: school work (67), general topic search (66), research 
(25), travel/tourism (21), projects (19), action-based (18), 
shopping (14), and status checking (5). As Table 8 shows, 
the largest task type was school work (28.51%), which is 
not surprising as the majority of participants were students. 
There is a large difference between tasks classified as 
school work by the diary participants (7.06% of diary study
