shows one low density trial. The edge-to-edge item 
spacings were 30 pixels (visual angle = 0.85°) in low 
density display. Unlike in Halverson and Hornof [15] and 
Pirolli, Card, and Van Der Wege [30] the size of thumbnails 
was held constant, so that density was manipulated by 
changing proximity only.
Number of pages had three levels: 1-page, 2-pages and 5- 
pages. Each page consisted of exactly 36 thumbnails (6 × 6 
square layout). In the 1-page condition, there were 36 
thumbnails in total and the first 36 of 180 thumbnails of 
sets were used. In 2-pages condition, 1st to 36th thumbnails 
were used in the first page; 37th to 72nd thumbnails were 
used in the second page and there were 72 thumbnails in 
total. In the 5-pages condition, all 180 thumbnails were 
used sequentially. There were page links below thumbnails 
in any page. It appeared all the time (see figure 1 and 2). 
Participants could click these links to switch between pages 
during a trial. So, when Participants searched in the first 
page, they also gained the information about how many 
pages in this task.
In total, there were 6 conditions (2 densities × 3 number of 
pages). Each condition had 30 trials. The total number of 
trials was 180. Each set of thumbnails could be arranged 
into one of six conditions. The presentations of each set of 
thumbnails were counterbalanced across subjects.
Apparatus
The experiment was performed with a Tobii 1750 eye 
tracker. The eyetracker is embodied in a 17” monitor. The 
eye tracker has a tracking rate or the frame rate of 50 Hz. 
The temporal resolution of 20 ms is sufficient for 
monitoring long fixation and eye movements in our task. 
Although low temporal resolution could cause noise in 
signal sampling, noise was reduced by averaging several 
gazes per page and by testing 30 trials per condition. The 
screen resolutions were set at 1024×768 pixels.
Participants
Participants were twenty four students from University of 
Manchester who received 5-10 pounds depending on their 
time for their volunteer. All participants were between 18 
and 28 years old and have normal vision or corrected-to-
normal vision.
Procedure
Participants were presented with instructions and then a 
practice block allowed them to become familiar with the 
task. After the practice block, the eye tracker system was 
calibrated. And then participants completed all 180 trials.
The whole Experiment took between 40 minutes and 70 
minutes depending on different participants. The variation 
in time was because we didn’t give our participants any 
time limitation. Some participants were faster than others.
The participant looked at a place label then clicked on the 
search button to make thumbnail search results appear. The 
participant was instructed to move the cursor to a thumbnail
of a visually attractive destination and click on it to finish a 
trial. The trial process and interface are shown in Figure 1.
Results
Normally, eye movement studies analysed participants’ 
search time, number of fixations and fixation duration. 
When we observed the participants’ search behaviour, we 
also found the gaze transitions were not always from one 
item to the next adjacent item; instead, participants skipped 
one or more items during their saccade. We calculated how 
many gaze transitions were not between spatially adjacent 
thumbnails. Therefore, in this study, we were interested in 
visual search performance, particularly in how (1) search 
time and (2) number of item gazes (all contiguous fixations 
on an item were combined to be a single gaze), (3) gaze 
duration (the sum of all fixation durations on a thumbnail 
prior to moving to another thumbnail), and (4) the 
proportion of skipping gaze transitions (the total number of 
gaze transitions divided by the number of skipping gaze 
transitions), are affected by the thumbnails density and 
number of pages. The data in the revisited page were not 
included. These four measures might reveal the adaptation 
of search strategy while participants interact with different 
item densities and number of items.
We predicted that when the thumbnails were displayed 
close together, participants would spend longer in a gaze, 
and be more likely to skip thumbnails during search in the 
display, than when thumbnails were displayed further apart. 
In addition, page links below the thumbnails indicated that 
the number of pages and total items in the task. We 
predicted that when there are more pages and thumbnails, 
people would adopt a different strategy which would be 
revealed by these four measures.
Overall Performance
Figure 3 illustrates the overall performance. There were 
significant main density effect on total search time (F(1,23) 
= 23.43, p &lt; 0.001), number of gazes (F(1,23) = 15.87, 
p=0.001), gaze duration (F(1,23) = 17.34, p &lt; 0.001), and 
proportion of skipping gaze transitions (F(1,23) = 35.04, 
p&lt;0.001). The results showed that participant spent less 
time (M = 12,709 ms vs 14,044 ms, figure 3a), fewer gazes 
(M = 8.16 vs 9.28, figure 3b), longer gaze (M = 407 ms vs 
387 ms, figure 3c) and skipped more often (M = 72.4% vs 
67.7%, figure 3d) in high versus low density.
There were significant main number of pages effects on 
total search time (F(2,46) = 136.54, p &lt; 0.001), number of 
gazes (F(2,46) = 73.18, p &lt; 0.001), gaze duration (F(2,46) = 
10.16, p &lt; 0.001), and proportion of skipping gaze 
transitions (F(2,46) = 8.37, p=0.001). A Bonferroni test 
revealed that every pairwise comparison was significantly 
different (p &lt; 0.05). According to the pairwise comparison, 
participants spent significantly less time (1-page: M = 7,514 
ms, 2-pages: M = 11,482 ms and 5-pages: M = 21,132 ms), 
gazed less (1-page: M = 10.96, 2-pages: M = 15.8 and 5- 
pages: M = 28.02), and skipped less often (1-page: M = 
66.5%, 2-pages: M = 70.7% and 5-pages: M = 72.9%), in
