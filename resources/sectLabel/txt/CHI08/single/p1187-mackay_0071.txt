documents (e.g., emails, web pages, word files) together 
based on a topic, a reminder tool or task scheduler for the 
tasks that you are working on, combining session saver with 
Landmarks to indicate not only the pages that you last saw 
but where you were on the pages, keeping a history of web 
pages where you could go back to where you were in the 
page, having a project management system, and having 
access to a log of web pages that you can visit from any 
computer.
Using the comments from the post-study interviews, and 
the information collected during the diary study and field 
study, we have identified three main features for browser 
tools that may assist users perform their multi-session tasks. 
First, participants indicated that they would like a reminder 
feature, such as the one shown in Figure 2 (c) to keep them 
on task and to remind themselves of tasks in progress 
during the current session. Participants liked using the 
browser for multi-session tasks because seeing the task 
name in the toolbar helped to keep them on task. Second, 
we found that participants, especially with the addition of 
tabbed browsing, typically worked on several tasks during a 
single web session and that any new tool should support 
multi-tasking. Third, participants commented that they 
would like to be able to manage their tasks between 
sessions, including being able to quickly return to viewed 
pages in their last seen state, to be able to better organize 
information associated with the task, and to easily manage 
the removal of saved web pages at the end of the task.
CONCLUSIONS
Using the information that we collected during the diary 
study, the field study, and the interviews we have been able 
to identify how experienced web users perform multi- 
session tasks and classify multi-session tasks.
While asking participants to self-report their multi-session 
tasks may have added bias into the studies; we felt it was 
necessary in order to gain a greater understanding of how 
users perform these tasks. We asked the field study 
participants if the customized browser influenced their web 
behaviour and the majority responded that it did not. The 
others mainly noted (as mentioned before) that the toolbar 
helped keep them on task. A few participants noted some 
technical difficulties that they experienced as well (such as 
the bookmark manager not working properly).
In the future, we will analyze the logged data from the field 
study to examine more closely how users switched between 
multi-session tasks and other web activities and to explore a 
better definition of session using the time data. We also 
plan to develop prototype tools based on our above findings 
and evaluate these in a field study.
