Figure 3: four measures of overall search performance per
density and number of page condition. (a) mean response
times; (b) mean number of gazes; (c) mean gaze duration
and (d) proportion of skipping gaze transitions for high
density (white bars) and low density (grey bars) in each
page set size. Error bars indicate 95% confidence intervals
and also in all figures below.
the fewer page condition. Also, pairwise comparison 
showed that they spent longer gaze duration in the 1-page 
condition (M = 401 ms) than 5-page condition (M = 369 
ms), although 2-pages is not significant different to 1-page 
and 5-pages condition. There were no significant 
interactions on total search time, number of gazes and gaze 
duration, except proportion of skipping gaze transitions, 
F(2,46) = 3.73, p &lt; 0.05.
Moreover, following Reiman, Young and Howes [34], we 
analysed the revisiting. Figure 4a shows the number of 
items that were visited at least once and revisited (i.e. 
visited at least twice) for each experimental condition. 
Participant revisited around 22% to 27% of visited items for 
each condition. Density and number of pages had similar 
effects on the number of visited and the number of revisited 
items. Participants visited and revisited more items in low 
density (all p’s &lt; 0.01) and when there were more pages (a 
Bonferroni test for analysing three page levels showed 
every pair was significantly different, p &lt; 0.001). In
number of pages
Figure 4: (a) mean number of items visited at least once
(bars with solid pattern) and items visited at least twice
(bars with line pattern) and (b) mean duration of an item
visited at the first time visit (bars with solid pattern) and
at the second time visit (bars with line pattern).
addition, figure 4b shows that our participants spent more 
time on an item when they revisited it than when they 
visited it the fist time, F(1,20) = 99.788, P &lt; 0.001.
Performance in the First Page
We analysed data in more detail. In this section we contrast 
performance in the first page of each condition. (Not all 
conditions had subsequent pages so the first page provides 
the critical test. In addition, it is the first page behaviour 
that should be affected by information about the number of 
pages, rather than by the quality of the additional items.) 
We analysed our four measures (search time, number of 
gazes, gaze duration and skipping rate) taken from the first 
page of search results. We conducted a 2 × 3 (density × 
number of pages) repeated-measure ANOVA for each 
measure separately.
Duration on a page was defined as the total time from the 
display onset to the time leaving the first page by click a 
page number link, or from the onset to the start of 
participants’ last fixation on the clicked target.
As expected, there was a main effect of density on mean 
search time in the first page, F(1,23) = 28.27, p &lt; 0.001. 
The search performance in the fist page was quicker in high 
density (M = 6082.24 ms) than low density (M = 6742.9 
ms). There was also a main effect of number of pages on 
search time of the first page, F(2,46) = 15.82,p &lt; 0.001.
