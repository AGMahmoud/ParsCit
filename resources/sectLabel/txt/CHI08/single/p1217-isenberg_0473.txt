curred before others (e. g., select most frequently appeared 
before operate), no common overall pattern appeared; sec-
ond, individuals varied in how they approached each task, 
and finally, teams also varied drastically in how they spent 
their time. For brevity, we present a few example charts. All 
charts for singles, pairs, and triples exhibit this same extreme 
variability of approach.
Figure 8 shows the coded temporal sequence of analytic pro-
cesses during Scenario B for three pairs. Notice how the 
sequence of processes was quite different for each pair, even 
though participants worked on the same tasks using the same 
tools, representations, and views of the data. Even within 
teams participants did not show the same temporal occur-
rences of processes. On average, participants in pairs were
concurrently working in the same process for ,: 70% of the
time. For Scenario B (Figure 8), P2 has a 65% co-occurrence 
of the same processes, P3 80%, and P4 69%. This reflects 
the collaboration strategies participants had chosen. P3 had 
switched from a complete task division to joint work in this 
scenario while P2 and P4 were working mostly in parallel. 
Participants in groups of three only showed a 40% co-occur-
rence of processes on average. In both charts in Figure 8, 
Tasks 1–3 were open discovery tasks and Tasks 4–6 were 
focused question tasks. We noticed that both individuals 
and teams solved focused question problems quicker than 
open discovery tasks. Teams had a better understanding of 
the tasks (established during the task strategy process) and 
solved them (both focused and open discovery tasks) more 
correctly. This result echoes findings in [10] that suggest that 
groups perform more accurately, albeit slower. Of course, 
teams also exhibit establishing a task strategy more so than 
individuals, again in order to establish common ground [6], 
or to ensure a correct or agreed-upon approach.
Figure 9 shows a detail view of a specific task, charting in-
dividual participants and three of the participant pairs. No-
tice that even for a single task occurring over a roughly five 
minute sequence, how the participants engaged in the task, 
and the temporal distribution of process time varied.

DISCUSSION
To this point, we have introduced a set of processes that oc-
cur within the context of collaborative and individual visual 
information analysis. These processes apparent from our 
study form an eight-process framework. The framework is 
unique from prior work in that it provides an understanding 
of how teams and individuals use information artefacts in the 
workspace to solve visual information analysis tasks and of 
how team members engage with each other during this pro-
cess. In this section, we discuss how our framework relates 
to other information analysis/information visualization mod-
els. This discussion reveals that while individual processes 
relate closely to existing models, our temporal analysis sug-
gests that with appropriate tools, both the collaborative and 
individual information analysis processes may naturally be 
more fluid and benefit from temporal flexibility.
Comparing Frameworks
Comparison with the Sense-Making Cycle
Card et al. [3, pp. 10] provide a high-level model of human 
activity called the “Knowledge Crystallization” or “Sense- 
Making Cycle” where the goal is to gain insights from data 
relative to some task. This model includes five main compo-
nents: foraging for data, searching for a schema (or repre-
sentational framework), instantiating a schema, problem
solving, and authoring, deciding or acting. It builds on
work by Russell et al. [13] which involved observations of 
collaborative work, and an extension can be found in [20].
The Sense-Making Cycle has several components related to QS C b	dl
our model. It outlines a process called “foraging for data” 
that includes our browse process. Spence [16] specifically 
explores the “foraging for data” component in terms of vi-
sual navigation. In particular, he relates visual navigation to 
cognitive activities (such as internal model formation and in-
formation interpretation), thereby arguing that how users can 
navigate, explore, and visualize a data space will shape how 
users think about the data. Spence distinguishes three dif-
ferent browsing activities [17]: exploratory browsing where
