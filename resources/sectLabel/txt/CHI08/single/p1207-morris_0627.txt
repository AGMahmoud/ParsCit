pages to allow active storage of search results for later 
review (by adding a “mark” button to all search results). 
SearchPad could optionally be docked into a Web browser 
to allow integration with search results, but did not persist 
when a user navigated away from a search results page.
The S3 [17] and SearchTogether [16] systems provide 
dedicated interfaces for conducting Web searches and 
record subsequent navigations into a persistent history that 
can be shared among users. Previous work (e.g. 
[8],[13],[15]) has explored alternative visual representations 
for Web history, but those systems have not used search 
queries as the primary organizational system for Web 
history. Like SearchBar, these tools all aim to assist users 
with informational search tasks; however, SearchBar differs 
from prior art in that it is a search-centric history 
mechanism that aims to assist users in regaining the context 
of multi-session investigations by providing both 
proactively gathered information (queries and subsequent 
pages visited) as well as optional explicit user annotations 
(topic designations, thumbs-up ratings, and notes).
CONCLUSION
The primary contributions of this work are threefold:
1) We presented results from a survey on Web search 
habits, which found that multi-session investigations are 
common. Along with the results from this survey, we 
presented a taxonomy of strategies presently used to 
maintain and restore context for exploratory searches.
2) We presented SearchBar, a novel tool for organizing 
Web history that supports re-acquisition of search context 
after interruptions. SearchBar uses search topics and search 
queries as its fundamental organizational metaphors to 
organize the Web pages subsequently browsed. An 
evaluation of this tool demonstrated that first-time users are 
able to effectively use this interface to complete a complex 
search task and make use of its affordances for re-finding 
information obtained via Web search.
3) We presented additional study results that describe the 
mechanisms used by Web searchers in general to re-find 
information and manage searches across interruptions, 
which will inform future work on SearchBar and related 
work on supporting Web search and multi-tasking.
Future work will include a broader deployment of 
SearchBar to explore the use of this tool over longer periods 
of time and within a larger user population. Future 
development of SearchBar will focus on automating the 
creation of search topics and delineating tasks based on user 
actions such as tab creation and initiation of new queries.
