current trends in HCI, such as embodied interaction [5]. 
This paper describes various ways in which blog reading is 
more than just reading. It leads the reader to form complex 
definitions of the term “blog,” each of which differs to 
varying degrees from the definitions used by bloggers. The 
paper also offers a view into the perception of the digital 
presentation of self in blogs. Blog reading allows for widely 
varied means of “being a part,” giving rise to new notions 
of community and belonging. This paper outlines the role of 
the reader in the activity of blogging, laying a general 
foundation for future work.
