group displayed a similar number of unique visitors – a fact 
we return to in later discussion.
Consistent with the notion that popular sites appear in the 
medium group, in this group we find pages from search 
engines (e.g. www.google.com and search.yahoo.com) as 
well as the homepages for BBC’s news site 
(news.bbc.co.uk) and Google news (news.google.com). 
Additionally, we find medium rate revisits for URLs on 
games Web sites such as Yahoo Games (games.yahoo.com) 
and Gamesville (www.gamesville.com).
Communication (Web mail and forums): Mail and forum 
pages are over-represented in this group. This is likely due 
to the timescale of human-to-human communication. That 
is, the turnaround in communication between two 
individuals through a Web mediated system appears to be 
more on the hourly or daily basis than significantly faster or 
slower. The width of the revisitation curve for this group 
indicates that there is considerable variability (both across 
and within individuals) in revisitation intervals. Survey 
respondents further indicated that “communication” was a 
reason to access a number of Web pages in this group.
.edu domain: The medium group also contained a 
significantly higher number of educational domain Web 
pages, with 35% (440 of 1245 .edu pages in the study) of 
the URLs coming from the .edu domain (versus 28%, 31%, 
and 4% for the fast, slow, and hybrid groups respectively). 
The high representation of educational pages may reflect 
the fact that student populations are particularly likely to re- 
access Web content at daily or weekly periods.
Browser homepages: According to the survey data, most 
browser homepages fell in this group, with none falling in 
the fast group, and few in the slow group. This is consistent 
with the fact that portals and search engines, both 
frequently used as browser homepages, appear in the 
medium group.
Slow Group -J
Pages with slow revisitation patterns were visited on 
average at intervals longer than a day. These pages most 
likely represented people’s long term interests and 
infrequent information needs.
Entry pages: Many pages appeared to be product home 
pages or the entry pages for specialty search engines (e.g. 
for travel, jobs, or cars). These pages were not used in a 
hub-and-spoke manner like the pages in the fast group, but 
were perhaps used to get to such pages.
Weekend activity: Cluster S2 _�_A exhibits a peak at a 
week. We hypothesize much of the activity in this cluster is 
related to weekend activity. For example, the page 
http://www.fetenet.com, which is close to the cluster’s 
centroid, contains event listings. The Movies category is 
the most distinguishing category for this cluster, followed 
by the Religion category, both of which further suggest 
weekend activity.
Search-engines used for revisitation: One trend we noted 
across groups was that as the revisitation period increased, 
the pages were more likely to be accessed from a search
