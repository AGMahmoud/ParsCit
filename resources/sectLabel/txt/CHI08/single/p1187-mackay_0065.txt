Table 1. An Excerpt from a Log File (Event Id 2506 to 2525 represent the continuation of a multi-session
task and at Event Id 2526 the participant returns to their other web activities)
name was the actual action that the participant performed 
(e.g., opened bookmark or followed link) and, when 
appropriate, how the action was performed (e.g., from the 
menu, using control keys, from the toolbar, etc.). The URL 
is the web page address for any pages visited on a browser 
action. Session Description recorded additional 
information on the multi-session tasks (e.g., when they 
were started, resumed and stopped).
In addition to capturing the user interactions, participants 
indicated when they started and continued to work on a 
multi-session task by using the interactive toolbar. To start 
a new task, participants pressed the “Start New Transient 
Task” button (note, for this study, we used our earlier label 
‘transient task’ to refer to multi-session task). Participants 
then filled in a web form shown in Figure 2 (b) that 
described the multi-session task (task title, task description, 
whether it was expected or not and estimated completion 
date). Once they selected the “Start” button on the web 
form, the name of the task would appear on the toolbar 
highlighted in yellow (Figure 2 (c)). Participants also 
indicated when a window or tab was included in the task 
with the “include/exclude” toggle buttons on the toolbar.
When the participants stopped the task (“Stop Task” 
button), another web form appeared in which the 
participants recorded information on the task they just 
worked on (what sub-task they worked on, whether they
finished the sub-task, why they stopped for that session, 
other applications used and if the task was finished). To 
resume a task later, the participant could select a task name 
from a drop-down list of active tasks that appeared when 
they selected the “Resume Task” button.
Participants also used the toolbar to submit their web logs. 
To submit their daily logs, they pressed the “Submit Log” 
button on the toolbar. Participants could view their logs 
(“View Log”) and could delete any URLs they did not want 
the researchers to see with the “Manage Log URLs” button.
At the end of the study, we met again with participants for a 
semi-structured interview that was formatted similarly to 
the interview given after the diary study, to discuss one of 
their multi-session tasks in more detail and multi-session 
tasks in general. This interview also gave us the opportunity 
to demonstrate and receive feedback for possible types of 
tools that may be useful for multi-session tasks. We 
demonstrated the same tools as in the diary study (with the 
exception of tabs) and also included ‘Google Notebook’.
Limitations of the Studies
While we did use a ‘convenient sample’, this provided us 
with an experienced set of web users. Our population and 
sample numbers are comparable to other studies [3, 6, 12, 
15] which also reported on experienced users (office 
workers or students) to acquire a deeper understanding of
