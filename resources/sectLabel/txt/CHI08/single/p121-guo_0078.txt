asked to perform the easier set first followed by the harder 
set.
Similar to task 1, we measure the task completion time and 
the number of errors. The task completion time in this task 
is defined as the time that elapsed since a new posture 
image was displayed on the screen till the time the 
participants completed the correct robotic posture. 
Completion time was measured automatically by the 
software according to the user sensed gestured, with a 
manual measurement for backup. The error in this case is 
defined as performing a posture that is different from the 
posture displayed on the screen. If a participant fails to 
perform the correct posture, then he/she needs to correct 
themselves. The time it takes the participants to think and 
correct their postures is also taken into account as part of 
the task completion time. Since the harder posture set 
requires the participants to move both forelegs of the AIBO, 
the actions can be preformed either sequentially or 
simultaneously. In this case, we did not constrain the 
participants to any of the input styles, allowing them to 
gesture either sequentially or simultaneously, as long as 
they feel it is the fastest and most intuitive way to complete 
the postures.
Interaction Techniques
For this task, the function mapping for the Wiimote 
interface is presented in Figure 7 and the mapping for the 
keypad interface is presented in Figure 8.
For the gesture input technique, the participants directly 
adjust the position of the forelegs of the AIBO using their 
own arms. Compare to the navigation task, the gesture-to-
robot action mapping in this case has an almost prefect 
degree of integration, and a high degree of compatibility [4].
For the keypad-to-robot action mapping, the four letter keys

on the OQO control the right foreleg of the AIBO. The four 
number keys control the left foreleg of the AIBO. By 
pressing either X or 8, the AIBO will perform Posture 1 
(Figure 6) with either its right foreleg or left foreleg. By 
pressing either Z or 9, the AIBO will perform Posture 2. By 
pressing either A or 6, the AIBO will perform Posture 3. By 
pressing either Q or 3, the AIBO will perform Posture 4 
(Figure 6).
The Data collected from this task was analyzed using a 2 x 
2 within-subjects ANOVA for the following two factors:
•	Technique: Wiimote/Nunchuk, Keypad
•	Posture: posture 1 to 12 (Figure 9).
RESULTS
Task 1 - Navigation
Task Completion Time
A 2 x 2 (Technique X Difficulty) ANOVA, with repeated 
measures on both factors, revealed no significant Technique 
X Difficulty interaction (F1,19 = 1.54, p = 0.23), which 
suggests that performance with the techniques is not 
substantially influenced by the difficulty level. There was a 
significant main effect for Technique, F1,19 = 12.19, p 
&lt;.001, indicating that overall task completion time for the 
Wiimote technique (M = 43.2s, SD = 6.9s) was 10% faster 
than for the keypad technique (M = 48.5 s SD = 6.7s) 
(Figure 10). As we expected, the main effect of Difficulty 
was significant, F1,19 = 115.61, p &lt; .001, with the mean 
jumping from M = 38.7s, SD = 4.6s for the easy trail to M = 
53.0s, SD = 8.1s for the hard trail.
Error
A two-way ANOVA was used to determine if there were 
differences on the number of errors (dependent variable) 
participants made using the Wiimote and keypad techniques 
when performed the navigation task under different 
difficulty levels. The result of the ANOVA showed no 
significant Technique X Difficulty interaction (F1,19 = 0.03, 
p = .87), which suggests that the number of errors made 
using different techniques is not significantly influenced by 
the difficulty level. There was a significant main effect for 
Technique, F1,19 = 9.81, p &lt; .01, indicating the errors that 
participants made using the Wiimote technique (M = 0.35, 
SD = 0.4) is 43% less than using the keypad technique (M = 
0.83, SD = 0.6). The result also showed a marginally 
significant main effect for Difficulty (F1,19 = 3.96, p = .06), 
with mean varying from M = 0.43, SD = 0.4 for the easy 
trail to M = 0.75, SD = 0.6 for the hard trail.
