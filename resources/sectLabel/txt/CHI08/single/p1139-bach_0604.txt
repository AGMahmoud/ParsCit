produced 229 category one eye glances. This difference 
was statistical significant, F(2, 45) = 7.08, p &lt; .01. When 
using gesture interaction, it was common for the subjects to 
use quick eye glances (below the fixation limit) to 
coordinate their hand with the gesture canvas. Almost half 
of the gesture interaction eye glances (44%) were category 
one. Somewhat surprisingly, this type of eye glances was 
not common for tactile or touch interaction, but it seemed 
that their hand/eye coordination often involved fixation 
time on the displays.
Figure 9. Number of eye glances for the three interaction 
technique on eye glance categories.
All three techniques yielded more category two glances (0.5 
- 2.0 seconds) compared the other glance categories. This is 
perhaps not surprising, but a repeated measures ANOVA 
showed significant difference between the techniques on 
these eye glances, F(2, 45) = 62.14, p &lt; .0001. A Tukey 
HSD post-hoc test showed significant difference at the 1% 
level between the gesture interaction and the two other 
techniques, but now significant difference between tactile 
and touch interaction. Perhaps not surprisingly, gesture 
interaction did not yield any eye glances of category 3 
(above 2 seconds), which is interesting due to their impact 
on driving performance. In contrast, the tactile and touch 
interaction techniques yielded 58 and 65 total eye glances. 
This difference was significant, F(2, 45) = 10.43, p &lt; .001.
The number of tasks solved with zero eye glances also 
differed across the interaction techniques, with 176 (out of 
480 possible) for the gesture interaction compared to 4 and 
35 for the touch interaction and tactile interaction 
respectively. If the three categories were given estimates for 
average duration (based on Green [9, 10] type 1 = 0.2 
seconds, type 2 = 0.8 seconds, type 3 = 2.4 seconds), the 
subjects would remove their eyes from the road for 60 
seconds using the tactile interaction technique compared to 
55 seconds with touch interaction and only 17 seconds for 
gesture interaction.
Controlled versus Simulated Driving
We chose to conduct the experiment both in a controlled 
driving environment and a simulated driving facility. This 
was chosen to reduce some of the known limitations of two 
settings. Not surprisingly, the settings illustrated a number 
of similarities and differences. Task completion times and 
interaction errors showed quite similar patterns for the two 
settings. Also, eye glances produced similar results with the 
exception of eye glance over 2.0 seconds where controlled 
driving subjects would have significantly more eye glances 
than simulated driving subjects. This is perhaps surprising 
given the safety critical condition for the controlled driving.
Longitudinal control was, however, quite different between 
the two settings. Controlled driving subjects had significant 
fewer longitudinal control errors than simulated driving 
subjects. It seemed that the lack of vehicle movement made 
it difficult to maintain the desired speed. Further findings 
on the impact of the settings can be found in [2].
Satisfaction
Overall, our subjects preferred gesture interaction to both 
touch and tactile interaction. However, all 16 test subjects 
indicated that they would use any of the three interaction 
techniques during real world driving. When asked to 
prioritize the three interaction techniques, gesture was 
ranked first by 10 participants, touch was preferred by 5 
while one participant preferred the tactile technique). The 
tactile interaction technique ranked third with 13 of the 16 
subjects (gesture interaction was ranked third by 3 subjects 
and the touch interaction was not ranked third by any 
subject).
The gesture based music player was characterized as being 
intuitive and very easy and fast to use while the tactile 
interaction based player (car stereo) was criticized for its 
small buttons and poor layout. The gesture interaction 
technique was generally described as very pleasant and less 
demanding and distracting than the other two interaction 
techniques.
DISCUSSION
In-vehicle systems research has shown that we need new 
ways of interacting with in-vehicle systems as conventional 
interaction techniques decrease driving performance (i.e. 
[10, 15, 16, 23]). We investigated three different interaction 
techniques in their abilities to support drivers interacting 
with in-vehicle systems while driving. In the following, we 
will discus our findings in terms of the three interaction 
techniques and reflect our findings against other research 
studies. In this discussion, we will pay special attention to 
the gesture interaction technique and we will also discuss 
possibilities of using multimodal interfaces.
Tactile Interaction
Tactile interaction was less intuitive and efficient than we 
had expected. With the highest average task completion 
times, the most eye glances, and the highest number of in-
complete assignments, tactile interaction was inferior to the
