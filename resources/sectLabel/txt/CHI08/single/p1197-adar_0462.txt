ANALYSIS OF REVISITATION PATTERNS
Using the properties described in Table 1, we characterized 
the pages that fell into each cluster group. Our findings 
were further supplemented by a manual examination of the 
Web pages closest to each cluster’s centroid. A summary 
of our findings can be found in Table 4. Unless noted 
otherwise, all results are significant as measured using 
ANOVA/Kruskal-Wallis with post hoc tests, or χ2-tests as 
appropriate. In most cases, a two-tailed significance level 
of p &lt; .0017 was used. This represents a .01 experiment- 
wise error rate using a Bonferroni correction for six 
dependent pair-wise tests. All differences in Table 4 are 
significant except for four pair-wise comparisons—the 
medium and hybrid groups do not differ in the unique 
visitors or URL length (chars); the fast and hybrid groups 
do not differ in % domain .com; and the slow and hybrid 
groups do not differ in % domain .edu. For tests involving 
terms or topics, X2-tests were used and the significance 
levels of individual tests were corrected to preserve an 
experiment-wise error rate of .01.
Fast Group ���—
Pages in the fast group tended to be revisited at intervals of 
less than an hour. Such sites elicit quick revisitation by 
forced reloads or shallow exploration and receive almost no 
long term revisitations. There are a number of reasons why 
Web pages may display a fast revisitation pattern.
Pornography &amp; Spam: A main category in fast group, and in
particular in cluster F1 ������, were spam or porn pages.
Thirty eight percent of the URLs in F1 (4746 of 12474) 
were categorized as Porn (compared to the average cluster 
which contained 923 pages of porn representing 16.5% of 
pages in that cluster). Pages in the fast group were also 
likely to contain words like “xxx”, “sex”, “photo”, and 
“free” in the URLs and the text of the pages. .
Hub &amp; Spoke: Many of the pages in the fast group appeared 
to exhibit a hub-and-spoke revisitation pattern. For 
example, a person may start at a list of all products, such as 
a table of blouses, visit an individual product description 
pages and then rapidly return to the original page to explore 
more options. As evidence of this “shopping page” 
behavior, fast pages were more likely than pages in other 
groups to contain the words, “buy”, “catalog”, or “shop” in 
the URL, and to belong to shopping-related categories. The 
two most popular categories for this group (seen in Table 4) 
are Home &amp; Garden and Clothes &amp; Accessories, both of 
which are comprised mostly of shopping pages.
We hypothesized that visits to hub-and-spoke pages would 
be particularly likely to be preceded by a visit to a page in 
the same domain, and we found that this was indeed the 
case. Seventy seven percent of all revisits in the fast group 
were from the same domain. This is significantly more 
than the percent of visits from the same domain to pages in 
the medium (43.8%) or slow (56.5%) groups. Additionally, 
the fast group had the highest number of links on the page 
pointing back at pages in the same site (87%). The longer
URLs for pages in this group is also consistent with pages 
reached by internal site navigation.
Shopping &amp; Reference Web sites: We found that not only 
specific Web pages but entire Web sites may display an 
over-representation of URLs in the fast group. These 
include a number of shopping/classifieds Web sites (e.g. 
Craigslist and Kelly’s Blue Book) as well as reference 
pages. For example, pages belonging to Wikipedia and the 
Internet Movie Database (IMDB) appeared more often in 
this group (though the homepages themselves were in the 
slow group). We may hypothesize that certain information 
needs, such as specific encyclopedia details, are localized 
temporally. User satisfying such needs may revisit 
frequently for the current information need, but do not 
generally return again for an extended period of time.
Auto refresh: Another reason for frequent fast revisits was 
that pages were auto-refreshing. For example, CNN’s 
homepage causes a browser refresh every 30 minutes, Fox 
New’s homepage every 10, Bloomberg every 5, and Sports 
Illustrated refreshes game scores every 60 seconds. In 
particular, pages in clusters F3 ���_ and F4 A�������, 
with peaks at five and ten minutes respectively, may be 
pages where much of the revisitation occurs from auto- 
refresh. Both clusters display an over-representation of the 
terms “meta refresh” and “window.location” corresponding 
to the HTML and Javascript reload mechanisms. Further 
supporting this hypothesis is the fact that the visited page 
immediately preceding pages in these clusters are exactly 
the same 29% of the time, compared with 12% of the time 
for pages in the medium group and 10% of the time for 
pages in the slow group.
Fast monitoring: From our user survey we found that 
monitoring applications in this domain tended to be for 
quickly changing information that required attention for a 
short period. For example, a page with local, up-to-the- 
minute traffic conditions was one such page.
Medium Group ���������������
Pages that fell in the medium-term revisitation group were 
visited hourly (M1 ���������������) or daily (M2 /��). Pages 
revisited hourly (M1) appeared to be portals, Web mail, and 
chat, as evidenced by keywords in the URL and topic 
classification. Pages in M2 were bank pages (bank and 
credit union URLs were very common), news pages, and 
sports pages.
Popular homepages: Pages in the medium group were 
among the most easily recognizable, with many being very 
popular. The URLs were significantly shorter at a mean of 
38.3 characters (versus 48.5 and 43.2 for fast and slow 
respectively) and a mean directory depth of 2.4 (versus 3.2 
and 2.7) indicating that they were more likely to be top 
level homepages. There were many more unique visitors to 
these Web sites than to others, with a mean number of 
254.3 visitors, compared with 40 for the fast group and 75 
for the slow group. Interestingly, however, the hybrid
