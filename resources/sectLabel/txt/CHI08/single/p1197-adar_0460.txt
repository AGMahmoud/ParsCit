Table 2. Relationship between visits and revisitation curves
Curve	Description
I   Rapid repeat visits
included a number of intranet pages which were used for 
additional qualitative analysis.
For each Web page in the survey, participants were asked 
whether they remembered visiting and revisiting the page. 
If they remembered the page, they were asked to indicate 
their intent when visiting from a list of options (e.g., to 
check for new information, to purchase, to communicate, 
etc.). If they recalled visiting the page more than once, they 
were further asked to describe how often they visited the 
page, and whether they visited it at regular intervals.
Web Page Content
The content of a Web page and its URL can also contain 
clues as to why the page was revisited. A custom crawler 
collected content information by downloading and indexing 
each Web page. Each page was crawled every hour for a 
month to examine the changes in page content over time. 
Although the times of the crawls do not correspond exactly 
with the revisitation observed in the logs, the crawled 
content is likely similar. We classified each Web page into 
topical categories using standard techniques [20]. The 
topical categories used are similar to those found in the first 
two levels of the Open Directory [18]. Additionally, a 
second classifier identified various generic genres including 
sites for children, mail, pornography, etc.
REVISITATION CURVES
Construction
To compare and evaluate revisitation behavior for different 
URLs we introduce the concept of a revisitation curve. A 
revisitation curve is a normalized histogram of inter-visit 
(i.e., revisit) times for all users visiting a specific Web page, 
and characterizes the page’s revisitation pattern.
Table 2 illustrates the relationship between page visits and 
revisitation curves. For each row, four page visits are 
represented as four tall bars along a time line. The 
revisitation curve is a histogram of the inter-visit times. 
The x-axis represents the inter-visit time interval, and the y- 
axis represents a count of the number of visits to the page 
separated by that interval. The specific density of visits 
determines the shape of the revisitation curve. For 
example, the page in the first row shows four visits in rapid 
succession, and none at longer intervals, so the revisitation 
curve shows a high number of revisitations in the smallest
interval bin. In contrast, visits in the second row are spread 
out which shifts the peak of the revisitation to the right 
(corresponding to a higher inter-arrival time bin). Note that 
the number of visits in each example is the same. That is, 
the same number of visits per user can result in very 
different revisitation curves.
Revisitation curves are generated first by calculating all 
inter-arrival times between consecutive pairs of revisits. 
Deltas, in minutes, are computed for all users revisiting a 
specific URL (Δminutes = floor(Δseconds / 60)). Because 
binning by minute results in very sparse data for slow 
revisits, 16 exponential bins were used to smooth the 
histograms and to provide a finer grained resolution than 
the six bins used in URL sampling. Some manual tuning of 
the bin boundaries was used to generate more descriptive 
timescales. The boundaries were 1, 5.5, 11, 32, 64 (~hour), 
98, 136, 212, 424, 848, 1696 (~day), 3392, 6784, 13568 
(~week), 27136 (~2 weeks), and 55000 minutes (~month).
Because histograms are count based, URLs that had many 
more visitors or more revisits per visitor had higher counts. 
In order to compare revisitation patterns between URLs we 
normalize each individual curve by the centroid (i.e. 
average) of all curves. This centroid is depicted in Figure 2 
(which also illustrates the effects of binning and bin 
location). This bottom curve shows the normalized 
histogram using the raw (un-binned) data. The periodicity 
in the figure corresponds to a 24 hour cycle and is likely 
due to the daily patterns of Internet usage. If a person has a 
“usual” time for Web surfing, this kind of periodic behavior 
will be seen in revisitation curves (similar to periodicities 
observed in re-finding behavior [19]). The top portion of 
the figure shows the smoother centroid curve that is 
obtained by summing over all points in each of the 16 inter- 
visit bins, which are shown as vertical lines.
To complete the normalization, for each URL the un-
normalized bins in each revisitation curve were divided by 
the corresponding count in the centroid.
