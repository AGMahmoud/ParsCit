Table 10: Predicting frequency of visits to Facebook
The regression equations show a differential pattern of uses 
and gratifications motivating frequency of visits to the site, 
and the time spent on the site. Gender (females visit more 
frequently) and scores on the ‘photographs’ and ‘status 
updates’ factors predict the frequency of visits to the site. 
Higher scores on both scales predicted more frequent visits. 
There was a marginally significant effect of ‘social 
investigation’ (higher scores related to less frequent visits).
However, participants age (younger spend more time) and 
scores on the content gratification scale predict the actual 
number of hours spent online. This suggests that 
surveillance gratifications motivate repeat visits, but that 
content gratifications motivate people to spend longer on 
the site when they do visit.

Table 11: Predicting time spent (hours) on Facebook
A final regression equation was calculated to predict the 
number of ‘friends’ users reported on Facebook (see Table 
12). Given that the number of friends should be related to 
the length of time users had been registered on Facebook, 
and the intensity of their use, the usage measures (length of 
time, frequency of visit, time spent on site) were entered 
alongside the remaining variables.
The overall model was significant (F (15, 196) = 8.48, p &lt; 
.001, R2 = .31).
As might be expected, age was associated with the number 
of ‘friends’ (younger have more ‘friends’), as was the 
amount of time users had been registered on the site and the 
frequency of their site visits (longer time registered, and 
more frequent visits, associated with more friends). 
Interestingly, scores on the ‘social connection’ scale were 
not associated with ‘friend’ numbers, while scores on the 
‘content gratification’ scale were negatively associated with 
the number of ‘friends’ (i.e. higher scores associated with 
smaller number of ‘friends’). Scores on the ‘social 
investigation’ scale were positively associated with the 
number of friends, while scores on the ‘photographs’ scale 
were marginally significantly associated with an increased 
number of friends.

Use of Facebook Privacy Settings and meeting new 
people
A final set of analyses were conducted to examine the 
relationship between specific uses and respondents’ 
reported privacy profile settings. The privacy settings of 
users were grouped, according to their responses, into those 
who reported making their profile less private (n=44), those
