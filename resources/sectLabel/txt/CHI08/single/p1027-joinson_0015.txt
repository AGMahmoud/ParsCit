Amongst all respondents, the most common responses for 
the time spent on the site each week were between 1 and 2 
hours (33.3%) and between 2 and 5 hours (32.5%). A 
relatively small proportion of users claimed to spend either 
less than 1 hour a week (16.9%) or between 5 and 10 hours 
(11.0%) on the site. The proportion of users claiming more 
than 10 hours Facebook use per week was small (5.4%).
Unlike previous research [13], the majority of users claimed 
to have changed the default privacy settings in Facebook, 
with 25.6% (n = 61) reporting making their profile 
‘somewhat’ more private, 21% (n = 50) ‘much more’ 
private and 10.9% (n = 26) making it ‘as private as 
possible. A smaller group claimed to have made their 
profile either more ‘open’ (9.2%, n = 22) or ‘as open to 
others as possible (9.2%, n = 22). The number of people 
making no changes to their profile (23.5%, n = 56) was 
substantially lower than that reported in previous studies 
[ 14].
The most important uses of Facebook tended to be related 
to the ‘social searching’ and surveillance functions (see 
Tables 2-8), identified by [16]. Specifically, the use of the 
site to learn about old friends and maintain or re-connect 
relations scored consistently highly. This pattern repeats 
previous findings from student samples [7, 16].
To investigate the nature of the various uses and 
gratifications of Facebook in more depth, exploratory factor 
analysis was conducted. The initial factor analysis (varimax 
rotation) yielded 9 components with eigenvalues over 1, 
explaining 64.8% of the variance. Examination of the scree 
plot and unique loadings suggested that seven components 
(explaining 59% of the variance) should be retained for 
further analysis. Only four items did not load on any of the 
factors: one was related to privacy settings, two about use 
of the ‘poke’ facility and one about leaving messages on the 
‘wall’.
INTERPRETATION OF FACTORS AND SCALE 
DEVELOPMENT
To aid further analysis, scales were developed from each 
factor. As a preliminary check, score distributions on each 
item were examined to ensure that none suffered from 
restricted range (i.e., the full range of response options was 
being used). This was the case for all items. Items were 
identified as markers of each factor based on the commonly 
used benchmark of a loading greater than .5. Items that had 
significant loadings on other factors were discounted as 
marker items [22].
Application of these criteria led to identification of eight 
marker items for Factor 1, three for Factors 2, four for 
Factor 3, four each for Factor 4 and 5, and three each for 
Factor 6 and 7.
Factor 1 (Table 2) contains items predominantly concerned 
with ‘keeping in touch’ (the most often mentioned use of 
Facebook in Study 1, and by [16]). The items have a clear 
focus on re-connecting with lost contacts and maintaining
contact with existing friends. Some of the items loading on 
this factor also clearly relate to the ‘surveillance’ function 
identified by [16], for instance, ‘Finding out what old 
friends are doing now”. Others are more closely related to 
the creation or maintenance of ‘weak ties’ (e.g. 
“Maintaining relationships with people you may not get to 
see very often”). Because of the combination of 
surveillance and social capital functions, this factor and 
related scale is labeled ‘social connection’. Two items 
loaded on this factor, but did not meet the criteria for factor 
purity: ‘Reading messages on your wall’ and ‘Seeing how 
old acquaintances look’).
Factor 1: Social connection (Cronbach’s Alpha = .89)	Item Mean (SD)	Loading
Finding out what old friends are doing now	5.08 (1.71)	.753
Reconnecting with people you’ve lost contact with	5.29 (1.79)	.783
Connecting with people you otherwise would have lost contact with	5.53 (1.61)	.842
Receiving a friend request	4.86 (1.68)	.601
Finding people you haven’t seen for a while	5.41 (1.66)	.850
Maintaining relationships with people you may not get to see very often	5.71 (1.56)	.764
Contacting friends who are away from home	5.46 (1.83)	.522
Table 2: Items and loading (Factor 1)
The second factor is comprised of three items related to the 
joining of groups, organization of events and meeting of 
‘like-minded people’ (see Table 3). These activities are akin 
to ‘social browsing’ identified by Lampe et al.; although 
there is no reason to assume that they are necessarily 
motivated by a desire to meet offline eventually. It also 
contains related to the discovery of new music and new 
groups via friends. As such, it seems to represent a ‘shared 
identities’ function. Two items (‘Seeing what kinds of 
networks and special interest groups your friends have’ and 
‘Learning about new music’) loaded on the factor, but did 
not meet the factor purity criteria.
Factor 2: Shared identities (Cronbach’s alpha .74)	Item Mean (SD)	Loading
Organizing or joining events	3.42 (1.82)	.699
Joining groups	3.52 (1.63)	.727
Communication with likeminded people	3.82 (1.76)	.638
