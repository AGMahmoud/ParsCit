sectionHeader ||| ABSTRACT
bodyText ||| Non-expert users face a dilemma when making security
bodyText ||| decisions. Their security often cannot be fully automated
bodyText ||| for them, yet they generally lack both the motivation and
bodyText ||| technical knowledge to make informed security decisions
bodyText ||| on their own. To help users with this dilemma, we present a
bodyText ||| novel security user interface called Sesame. Sesame uses a
bodyText ||| concrete, spatial extension of the desktop metaphor to
bodyText ||| provide users with the security-related, visualized system-
bodyText ||| level information they need to make more informed deci-
bodyText ||| sions. It also provides users with actionable controls to
bodyText ||| affect a system&apos;s security state. Sesame graphically facili-
bodyText ||| tates users&apos; comprehension in making these decisions, and
bodyText ||| in doing so helps to lower the bar for motivating them to
bodyText ||| participate in the security of their system. In a controlled
bodyText ||| study, users with Sesame were found to make fewer errors
bodyText ||| than a control group which suggests that our novel security
bodyText ||| interface is a viable alternative approach to helping users
bodyText ||| with their dilemma.

bodyText ||| The above are examples of actual alerts [15] that users are
bodyText ||| given from their anti-virus, anti-spyware and firewall tools.
bodyText ||| While some alerts are purely informational, most require
bodyText ||| users to make a decision. The choices they face are often
bodyText ||| âAlwaysâ, âThis one timeâ or âNever,â posing the quandary
bodyText ||| of whether to suffer through even more messages or perform
bodyText ||| an action that may be irreversible. Further, the information
bodyText ||| given to help users make these decisions is often highly
bodyText ||| technical or vague (e.g., âDestination IP: 192.168.0.1:
bodyText ||| DNSâ or âThis program has changed since the last time it
bodyText ||| ran!â). Even when tools have a âMore Infoâ button to
bodyText ||| provide access to more detailed information, that information
bodyText ||| is often confusing as well.
bodyText ||| How do users cope with such security decisions? Some turn
bodyText ||| to online research in an attempt to comprehend the alerts.
bodyText ||| This strategy is evident in the multitude of online forums
bodyText ||| where users ask questions, sharing their collective wisdom
bodyText ||| about such decisions (e.g., antionline.com or fo-
bodyText ||| rumz.tomshardware.com). In contrast, some cope by simply
bodyText ||| ignoring pop-ups or warnings from their security tools [20].
bodyText ||| In fact some security books even advise users to turn off the
bodyText ||| annoying alerts; for example, one self-help security book
bodyText ||| quips, âthe [stop alerts] button should say Shut Up, You are
bodyText ||| Driving Me Crazyâ [15].
bodyText ||| Simply put, users are asked to make decisions about things
bodyText ||| they do not understand, based on information that is difficult
bodyText ||| to comprehend. The poor decision making that (expectedly)
bodyText ||| is an outcome of this can result in dire consequences [18],
bodyText ||| including phishing attacks, bot infestations, and various
bodyText ||| forms of malware
bodyText ||| End-user security decisions present a troubling dilemma. On
bodyText ||| the one hand, because users must be involved in deciding
bodyText ||| how to balance security risks against the work they want to
bodyText ||| accomplish, many of these decisions are impossible to
bodyText ||| effectively automate [2, 3, 4, 5, 6] (e.g., as in the case of
bodyText ||| personal firewalls). On the other hand, the users who must
bodyText ||| make these decisions are generally uninterested in security as
bodyText ||| an end in itself [18] and, as noted, often have little useful
bodyText ||| information to help them make good decisions [4, 16].
bodyText ||| Further, most of these decisions require a level of technical
bodyText ||| knowledge not possessed by most end-users. The key ques-
bodyText ||| tion this paper then explores is: since users must make
bodyText ||| security decisions (in particular, ones requiring system-level
bodyText ||| knowledge), how can we help them understand their system
bodyText ||| well enough to make better-informed security choices?

figureCaption ||| Figure 1: The Sesame âBehind-the-Scenesâ View running on a live system
bodyText ||| We explore this issue of informed security decision making
bodyText ||| through Sesame, an interactive, visual, firewall-like tool
bodyText ||| designed to assist non-experts in making better informed
bodyText ||| security decisions. Sesame addresses threats similar to those
bodyText ||| of consumer firewalls, but uses a visual, direct manipulation
bodyText ||| interface that exposes system-level information in a meaning-
bodyText ||| ful, comprehensible way. To this end, Sesame provides users
bodyText ||| a âbehind-the-scenesâ view of their computer, integrating
bodyText ||| existing elements of the desktop UI (such as windows) with
bodyText ||| previously hidden systems-level components (such as the
bodyText ||| processes that own those windows, the network connections
bodyText ||| those processes are making, and so forth). Essentially, the
bodyText ||| desktop metaphor is extended to convey system-level con-
bodyText ||| cepts in terms of their relationship to familiar desktop-level
bodyText ||| abstractions. We conjecture that this view can help to inform
bodyText ||| user security decisions and, by lowering barriers to this
bodyText ||| information, may help to motivate them as well [18].
bodyText ||| Our initial study results suggest that this behind-the-scenes
bodyText ||| view of their systemâs underlying architecture seems to help
bodyText ||| users make better security decisions involving system-level
bodyText ||| knowledge. In the sections that follow, we briefly survey
bodyText ||| current research and commercial security tools. We then
bodyText ||| describe the design of the Sesame UI and present the results
bodyText ||| of our user study. We conclude with a discussion of our
bodyText ||| study results and implications for future work.
sectionHeader ||| RELATED WORK
bodyText ||| While there are many security tools available, few are
bodyText ||| designed specifically to support end-users in their security
bodyText ||| decision making process. However, of the tools available for
bodyText ||| security decision making, many can be grouped into two
bodyText ||| categories: those for expert users and those for non-experts.
subsectionHeader ||| Experts
bodyText ||| Visualization tools: The majority of prior research focuses on
bodyText ||| visualization-based approaches intended for the expert user.
bodyText ||| While inappropriate for non-experts, they do illustrate types
bodyText ||| of information that experts find useful in order to detect
bodyText ||| security problems and make informed decisions with regard
bodyText ||| to security. For example, many of these tools support moni-
bodyText ||| toring of network connections; these include Rumint, IDS
bodyText ||| Rainstorm, VisAlert [7], and others that provide experts with
bodyText ||| a variety of useful network data representations [1]. How-
bodyText ||| ever, these tools are highly technical and complex
bodyText ||| (presenting data at the level of individual packets), and do
bodyText ||| not integrate with, or build on, existing metaphors of the
bodyText ||| desktop GUI.
bodyText ||| Text-based tools: Another set of very common tools provides
bodyText ||| extensive system behavior and status information in a text-
bodyText ||| based approach. Although these systems often ship on
bodyText ||| consumer computing platforms, they are generally intended
bodyText ||| for knowledgeable users or even system- or network-
bodyText ||| administrators. These include tools like ProcessExplorer,
bodyText ||| tcpview, and Windows Task Manager [22]. Again, these
bodyText ||| tools present system-level information useful in making
bodyText ||| informed security decisions. However, they convey informa-
bodyText ||| tion in a piecemeal fashion (different tools for different
bodyText ||| information), leaving users to assimilate and make sense of
bodyText ||| it; and the textual presentation neither supports visual meta-
bodyText ||| phors nor integrates with the existing and well-known
bodyText ||| features of the desktop UI.
subsectionHeader ||| Non-Experts
bodyText ||| In contrast to the wealth of tools available for network and
bodyText ||| security professionals, research in the area of supporting
page ||| 1046
note ||| CHI 2008 Proceedings Â· Am I Safe	April 5-10, 2008 Â· Florence, Italy
bodyText ||| security decision making for end users remains nascent [4,
bodyText ||| 18]. Discussed below are two classes of such tools.
bodyText ||| Tools for specific activities: Some tools for non-experts
bodyText ||| provide support only for security decisions that relate to a
bodyText ||| specific user activity, e.g., browsing, searching, making
bodyText ||| online transactions, sharing files, and so forth [2, 3, 21]. For
bodyText ||| example, Web Wallet [19] can be used to ensure that a userâs
bodyText ||| information will be sent to the desired site rather than to a
bodyText ||| spoof. While these tools help support security decisions in
bodyText ||| the context of a specific activity, they do not address the
bodyText ||| range of âsystem levelâ security situations that are independ-
bodyText ||| ent of what the user is doing. Consequently, security
bodyText ||| decisions which do not map to a specific activity are largely
bodyText ||| overlooked by these tools. For example, a spyware or bot
bodyText ||| infection can severely endanger a userâs privacy and security
bodyText ||| regardless of what actions the user is performing [13,9].
bodyText ||| Further, since different tools are employed for different
bodyText ||| activities, the level of security, as well as the user interface,
bodyText ||| can easily be inconsistent. This is not to say that security
bodyText ||| tools are only effective if they support all security decisions
bodyText ||| across all activities, but rather that activity-specific tools are
bodyText ||| not a complete answer to end-user security.
bodyText ||| Tools for specific threats: Other tools provide support for
bodyText ||| user decisions based on specific types of threats such as anti-
bodyText ||| phishing toolbars, anti-virus, -adware, and âspyware sys-
bodyText ||| tems. These tools tend to be based on heuristics or black lists
bodyText ||| and will only provide protection for against attacks matching
bodyText ||| their heuristics or that are on their lists. Users must con-
bodyText ||| stantly update these tools in order for them to be effective;
bodyText ||| and the way in which they alert users to problems is also
bodyText ||| problematic, as evidence shows that users often find the
bodyText ||| information in these alerts to be difficult to understand and so
bodyText ||| ignore them [20, 4].
bodyText ||| Consumer firewalls are perhaps the most common types of
bodyText ||| security software that involves explicit user decision-making.
bodyText ||| These systems protect against a range of network-based
bodyText ||| attacks, such as worms that exploit software vulnerabilities.
bodyText ||| These systems are not task-specific, but present system-level
bodyText ||| information in a way that is often undecipherable to users
bodyText ||| (e.g., describing connection attempts in terms of process
bodyText ||| names, IP addresses, and port numbers). Users therefore
bodyText ||| have little actionable information on which to base security
bodyText ||| decisions when faced with firewall popups.
bodyText ||| Thus, there are few systems that attempt to provide users
bodyText ||| with a framework for making security decisions that are not
bodyText ||| tied directly to a specific activity, but instead help with
bodyText ||| overall system security. Our goal with Sesame is to fill this
bodyText ||| void; to provide general, firewall-like security (not, for
bodyText ||| example, detecting of malware at the point of installation),
bodyText ||| while helping users to make informed decisions. We focused
bodyText ||| specifically on handling common classes of attacks where
bodyText ||| user action is necessary to determine the correct course of
bodyText ||| action. These include situations where there is no universally
bodyText ||| correct action, but rather a tradeoff between security and
bodyText ||| convenience that the user must consider, or situations where
bodyText ||| the correct action is dependent on context outside of the
bodyText ||| system. Thus, unlike current firewallsâwhich convey
bodyText ||| systems-related information textually, using low-level
bodyText ||| technical detailsâSesame provides a holistic graphical
bodyText ||| representation of security-related system information in a
bodyText ||| way designed to be understandable by end-users. Sesame
bodyText ||| also provides a means for exploration of the underlying
bodyText ||| system, allowing it be used for a greater range of purposes
bodyText ||| than traditional consumer firewalls.
sectionHeader ||| DESIGN PROCESS
bodyText ||| In this section we discuss our iterative design process and
bodyText ||| choice of the representational paradigm for Sesame.
subsectionHeader ||| Representational Paradigm
bodyText ||| Our overarching goal with Sesame is to convey a visual
bodyText ||| model that allows security-related system information to be
bodyText ||| meaningfully interpreted by the user. To do so, we chose a
bodyText ||| direct manipulation, model-world paradigm, as this is known
bodyText ||| to have significant benefits for learnability [8]. Within this
bodyText ||| interface we sought to 1) show how important but unfamiliar
bodyText ||| abstractions (e.g., processes and networks) relate to abstrac-
bodyText ||| tions that are familiar and meaningful to users (e.g., windows
bodyText ||| and real-world places); and 2) provide users with actionable
bodyText ||| controls that enable them to affect their security state using
bodyText ||| the information given.
bodyText ||| We believed a spatial, direct-manipulation interface would
bodyText ||| yield a number of important benefits, the first of which is to
bodyText ||| leverage existing knowledge. Our target, non-expert user
bodyText ||| already typically interacts with the computer through the
bodyText ||| spatial metaphor of the desktop GUI, which allows us to
bodyText ||| leverage that experience to convey other, more complex
bodyText ||| relationships via a similar spatial GUI. More subtly though,
bodyText ||| desktop objects are familiar and meaningful to users; by
bodyText ||| employing an interface that is metaphorically compatible
bodyText ||| with the desktop, it should be easier to represent relationships
bodyText ||| between esoteric security abstractions and the familiar
bodyText ||| windows and things found on the desktop. The second
bodyText ||| reason to use a visual representation is speed. The human
bodyText ||| visual system has an enormous facility for the rapid assess-
bodyText ||| ment of visual scenes [ 14]. By presenting data in this way, as
bodyText ||| opposed to a more verbose text-based approach, we hope to
bodyText ||| minimize the time users need to assess their security situation
bodyText ||| in any particular instanceâthereby reducing one of the
bodyText ||| known barriers to user motivation for understanding security
bodyText ||| [18].
subsectionHeader ||| Information Content
bodyText ||| Portraying all low-level information about the state of the
bodyText ||| userâs system would not only potentially be overwhelming,
bodyText ||| but also likely unnecessary for protection against the classes
bodyText ||| of threats we are targeting. Thus, we do not attempt to depict
bodyText ||| all possible system information, but focus instead on a
bodyText ||| smaller subset selected through an analysis of whether the
bodyText ||| information is both practically accessible and relevant in
bodyText ||| addressing the common types of security threats we are
bodyText ||| targeting (spyware, phishing, and bot infections).
page ||| 1047
note ||| CHI 2008 Proceedings Â· Am I Safe	April 5-10, 2008 Â· Florence, Italy
bodyText ||| Thus, the information we depict includes:
listItem ||| â¢	Process characteristics, including depictions of which
listItem ||| windows are associated with a given process, average and
listItem ||| current CPU usage, putative vendor, whether that vendor
listItem ||| can be confirmed, and process installation date;
listItem ||| â¢	Network characteristics, including incoming and outgoing
listItem ||| connections;
listItem ||| â¢	Remote systems, including domain, putative owning
listItem ||| organization, and putative geographical location.
bodyText ||| Although far from comprehensive, the above data set pro-
bodyText ||| vides enough information to identify and potentially mitigate
bodyText ||| many variants of the three types of attacks on which we
bodyText ||| focus. Spyware, for example, could be identified by routine
bodyText ||| attempts at establishing connections from suspicious proc-
bodyText ||| esses targeted at suspicious remote servers. A bot infection
bodyText ||| could be detected similarly, except in some cases the remote
bodyText ||| systems would be initiating the connections. In this sense,
bodyText ||| Sesame goes further than current firewalls, enabling users to
bodyText ||| proactively explore security risks. For example, some phish-
bodyText ||| ing scams could be identified by observing oneâs web
bodyText ||| browser connecting to servers that appear unaffiliated with
bodyText ||| the nominal proprietor of the website. We used situations
bodyText ||| like these to evaluate Sesame as described below in our User
bodyText ||| Study section.
subsectionHeader ||| Formative Study
bodyText ||| To get feedback on potential approaches for visual presenta-
bodyText ||| tion and terminology, we conducted a small formative study
bodyText ||| early in our design process. This formative study was in-
bodyText ||| tended to provide feedback on (1) user preferences with
bodyText ||| respect to concrete versus abstract representations of system
bodyText ||| information, (2) ability of users to decipher relationships
bodyText ||| among system information, and (3) preferred terminology for
bodyText ||| technical concepts. We showed three users paper prototypes
bodyText ||| of two designs, one using a concrete, spatial visualization
bodyText ||| similar to that of figure 1, and another using more a more
bodyText ||| abstract presentation. Participants overwhelmingly preferred
bodyText ||| the more concrete representation, and understood many of
bodyText ||| the relationships being conveyed (such as relationships
bodyText ||| between processes and windows) without explanation by the
bodyText ||| experimenters.
bodyText ||| This brief, early study was also helpful in revealing what
bodyText ||| participants did not understand. For example, participants
bodyText ||| had difficulty understanding that a part of the visualization
bodyText ||| represented physically remote computers on the Internet. Our
bodyText ||| discussions with participants also informed a number of
bodyText ||| elements of our final design, such as the use of geographic
bodyText ||| maps to suggest remoteness. Other feedback led to signifi-
bodyText ||| cant changes in the arrangement of processes used in the
bodyText ||| final version of Sesame. Finally, an additional discovery we
bodyText ||| made during the formative study was that the term âprocessâ
bodyText ||| caused significant confusion for our non-technical users.
bodyText ||| Based on participant feedback, we chose the term âengineâ as
bodyText ||| one that made more sense to them. (We acknowledge,
bodyText ||| however, that using such non-standard terms may confuse
bodyText ||| the more âtechnicalâ users.)
sectionHeader ||| SESAME: EXTENDING THE DESKTOP
bodyText ||| In this section we describe how the system level information
bodyText ||| is presented in Sesame, and the controls given to users for
bodyText ||| interacting with the tool.
subsectionHeader ||| Invocation - Getting âbehind-the-scenesâ
bodyText ||| Among the first design choices we faced was deciding where
bodyText ||| to place Sesame in relation to the desktop. Our requirement
bodyText ||| to connect existing elements (such as windows) to Sesame-
bodyText ||| provided elements (such as processes) meant that the tool
bodyText ||| somehow had to be integrated into the desktop. However it
bodyText ||| could not appear to be âjust another applicationâ running on
bodyText ||| the desktop, because we needed to convey that Sesame is a
bodyText ||| level of abstraction âbelowâ the conventional GUI.
bodyText ||| To resolve this challenge, users can access Sesame either by
bodyText ||| invoking the always-present âOpen Sesameâ button on the
bodyText ||| desktop, or through a dialog box that appears when Sesame
bodyText ||| needs to interact with the userâfor example, when a process
bodyText ||| requests a connection (the user may ignore the dialog box if
bodyText ||| they do not wish to respond). When Sesame is invoked, the
bodyText ||| userâs desktop GUI rotates about the vertical axis to reveal
bodyText ||| the processes, networks, and other system-level elements
bodyText ||| behind it (Figure 1). To exit from the view, users click the
bodyText ||| exit button at the top of the screen. A benefit of this smooth
bodyText ||| rotation effect is that it provides a continuous transition from
bodyText ||| the desktop interface to Sesame to keep users from becoming
bodyText ||| disoriented.
bodyText ||| Rotating the entire desktop to display the Sesame visualiza-
bodyText ||| tion raises several problems. The first is that a full-screen
bodyText ||| visualization is heavyweight, and may dissuade users from
bodyText ||| invoking it when they do not have to. It further means that
bodyText ||| the user cannot have the Sesame visualization visible while
bodyText ||| performing other tasks. These issues of motivation and
bodyText ||| efficiency may be important to explore in the future, but at
bodyText ||| this stage we are principally concerned with effective infor-
bodyText ||| mation representation. A full screen visualization helps us
bodyText ||| with this by offering conceptual advantages in showing the
bodyText ||| desktop/system-level separation, as well as the practical
bodyText ||| advantages of providing abundant space for the system-level
bodyText ||| components we wish to show.
subsectionHeader ||| Division of Space
bodyText ||| Once behind the desktop, we faced another design challenge.
bodyText ||| The effect of rotating the desktop is intended to suggest that
bodyText ||| the revealed objects are part of the userâs PC. Yet to convey
bodyText ||| abstractions such as remote computers, we also needed to
bodyText ||| represent areas that lie outside the userâs PC. Thus, Sesame
bodyText ||| provides a clean division where one side of the visualization
bodyText ||| (furthest from the rotated desktop) contains all external
bodyText ||| elements such as remote computers, and the other side
bodyText ||| (containing the rotated desktop) represents the internal
bodyText ||| elements of the userâs PC; both regions are labeled and are
bodyText ||| colored differently to emphasize the distinction.
subsectionHeader ||| Visual Elements
bodyText ||| In addition to the rotated desktop, the Sesame visualization
bodyText ||| contains several distinct types of visual elements: proc-
bodyText ||| esses, remote computers and connection requests. As
page ||| 1048
note ||| CHI 2008 Proceedings Â· Am I Safe	April 5-10, 2008 Â· Florence, Italy
bodyText ||| shown in Figure 1, blue cubes (representing window-
bodyText ||| owning processes) are connected via arrows to each of the
bodyText ||| windows on the rotated desktop. Directly beneath them are
bodyText ||| the non-window-owning processes, referred to as âback-
bodyText ||| groundâ processes. On the right, in the âexternalâ region,
bodyText ||| are representations of remote computers that are connected
bodyText ||| via arrows to the process with which they are communicat-
bodyText ||| ing. However, before the remote computers can connect to
bodyText ||| the userâs system, a connection request is given to the user
bodyText ||| with options to âAllowâ or âForbidâ the connection. Also, in
bodyText ||| the lower right corner is a âMore Infoâ space providing
bodyText ||| brief descriptions when the user hovers over the various
bodyText ||| visual elements.
subsubsectionHeader ||| Processes
bodyText ||| Processes are arranged either floating parallel to the rotated
bodyText ||| desktop or lying on the ground, depending on whether they
bodyText ||| own windows (âforegroundâ processes) or not (âback-
bodyText ||| groundâ). To highlight the difference between them, the
bodyText ||| foreground processes are larger and in blue; the back-
bodyText ||| ground processes are smaller and in green. This difference
bodyText ||| in representation was the result of our earlier formative
bodyText ||| user studies: we found that users preferred significant
bodyText ||| visual differences between the process types.
bodyText ||| To avoid deluging users with processes, only certain ones
bodyText ||| are shown: 1) we show all processes that own windows as
bodyText ||| we want to suggest to users that all of their interaction with
bodyText ||| the computer is mediated by processes; 2) we show all
bodyText ||| processes that have ever connected to the network; and 3)
bodyText ||| we cull any process that is a known-safe component of the
bodyText ||| Windows OS, unless it is being controlled by another,
bodyText ||| untrusted process.
bodyText ||| Much of the security-related, system information provided
bodyText ||| is actually conveyed with the process cube. On its face is
bodyText ||| the name of the executable from which it was started.
bodyText ||| There is also a small square, a rectangular bar graph, and a
bodyText ||| gauge (Figure 2a). The colored square indicates whether
bodyText ||| the vendor of the executable could be verified (green for
bodyText ||| yes, yellow for no); the bar graph indicates how long the
bodyText ||| executable has been installed on the userâs system; and the
bodyText ||| gauge indicates both current and average CPU usage.
bodyText ||| These three indicators provide users with a fast way of
bodyText ||| judging if a process is behaving abnormally. Part of Ses-
bodyText ||| ameâs design intent is to help users identify abnormal
bodyText ||| behavior by developing a sense of what normal behavior
bodyText ||| looks like via the three indicators. To augment their ability
bodyText ||| to have a sense of ânormalâ and in keeping with the safe-
bodyText ||| staging principle [17], we also use in-place semantic
bodyText ||| zooming, allowing users to learn more information when
bodyText ||| they want. When users hover over a process cube with the
bodyText ||| mouse, it expands slightly to show small explanatory text
bodyText ||| labels next to each of the glyphs on the cubeâs face (Figure
bodyText ||| 2b). To obtain an even more complete explanation, users
bodyText ||| can click the cube, expanding it to a full-sized representa-
bodyText ||| tion, which also contains an editable list of security policies
bodyText ||| applied to the process (Figure 2c). Consequently, users can
figureCaption ||| Figure 2a: unexpanded	Figure 2b: view of process
figureCaption ||| process	when hovered over
figureCaption ||| Figure 2c: process when clicked upon
figureCaption ||| Figure 3b: Process-to-remote system arrow
bodyText ||| visually determine whether a given processâ characteristics
bodyText ||| are unusual, then zoom in to learn what they actually mean.
bodyText ||| Coming out from the edges of processes are wide arrows
bodyText ||| joining them to the windows they own and the remote
bodyText ||| computers with which they are communicating (Figures 3a,
bodyText ||| 3b). The intention here is to connectâboth conceptually
bodyText ||| and diagrammaticallyâconcepts in the Sesame interface
bodyText ||| with familiar related concepts on the userâs desktop and in
bodyText ||| the real world. The arrows are rendered in bright colors
bodyText ||| with an extruded, gradated appearance to draw attention
bodyText ||| and make them feel concrete. We chose double-headed
bodyText ||| arrows to imply that information flows both ways.
subsubsectionHeader ||| Remote Computers
bodyText ||| The remote computers that act as either servers or, less
bodyText ||| likely, clients to the userâs computer are represented as
bodyText ||| stacked rectangular tiles on the right of the screen. In
bodyText ||| earlier versions of Sesame, we tried to depict the remote
bodyText ||| computers as actual concrete renderings of computers; but
bodyText ||| as it was not clear to users that these were separate from
bodyText ||| their PCs. Users tended to feel that a better way to suggest
bodyText ||| distantness would be to use maps, which prompted us to
bodyText ||| render remote computers as abstract map images overlaid
bodyText ||| with pointers to the putative location of the remote system.
bodyText ||| The arrows leading from the processes to the remote
bodyText ||| system tiles terminate over the geography of the remote
bodyText ||| system, and the panels include a textual description (e.g.,
bodyText ||| âRemote computer owned by XYZ Corpâ).

figureCaption ||| Figure 4: expanded remote system tile
bodyText ||| As with processes, remote system tiles also allow semantic
bodyText ||| zooming. When the mouse hovers over a tile, it expands to
bodyText ||| reveal the domain, owner, and more precise geographic
bodyText ||| location associated with the remote system; the information
bodyText ||| is obtained via a reverse DNS lookup and query of a WHOIS
bodyText ||| database of domain registrations (Figure 4).
subsubsectionHeader ||| Connection Requests
bodyText ||| When an attempt is made to establish a new incoming or
bodyText ||| outgoing connection, the firewall component of the Sesame
bodyText ||| backend intercepts the request and Sesame asks the user for
bodyText ||| permission. Sesame represents the connection attempt by
bodyText ||| showing a double headed arrow between the local process
bodyText ||| and remote system tile, but the arrow is solid only on the side
bodyText ||| initiating the request, with the other end of the arrow dotted
bodyText ||| (Figure 5). There is a gap between the two ends of the arrow
bodyText ||| to suggest that they could be, but are not yet, connected. To
bodyText ||| make the userâs options more clear, the buttons where the
bodyText ||| user can accept or forbid the request appear at this
bodyText ||| solid/dotted junction. In order to draw the userâs attention to
bodyText ||| the choice, the red border around the buttons flashes for
bodyText ||| several seconds after Sesame is invoked. To ensure that users
bodyText ||| see the process associated with the connection request, a
bodyText ||| border flashes around it as well.
bodyText ||| Like current firewalls, Sesame allows the user to set policies
bodyText ||| for allowing or denying connections; but unlike most fire-
bodyText ||| walls, we try to make changes affecting future policy
bodyText ||| obvious by representing policies concretely, and visually
bodyText ||| associating them with the objects to which they apply. When
bodyText ||| the user selects the âacceptâ or âforbidâ buttons, a policy
bodyText ||| dialog box is shown animating out of the relevant process
bodyText ||| cube and expanding to full size on screen. The user can
bodyText ||| select from four policy choices, allowing or denying connec-
bodyText ||| tions on a one time basis or indefinitely, and with respect to
bodyText ||| any remote computer or just those associated with a particu-
bodyText ||| lar domain. Once the user confirms their policy choice, the
bodyText ||| selected policy (represented as a card) is animated to disap-
bodyText ||| pear directly into the associated process, conveying that the
bodyText ||| policy is âinsideâ that cube and is later accessible from it.
subsectionHeader ||| Usage Scenarios
bodyText ||| To demonstrate how Sesame might be used, we include two
figureCaption ||| Figure 5: Remote computer requesting connection to local
figureCaption ||| process.
bodyText ||| usage scenarios in which we show similar situations, one
bodyText ||| where the appropriate action is to allow a connection so that
bodyText ||| the user can continue with her task; and one where the
bodyText ||| appropriate action is to deny it in order to fend off an attack.
bodyText ||| In the first, the user is asked to answer an explicit question
bodyText ||| by Sesame about whether to allow access to a remote system.
bodyText ||| In the second, the user invokes Sesame herself to try to
bodyText ||| decide whether a website is fraudulent.
subsubsectionHeader ||| Scenario 1: Should I allow this connection?
bodyText ||| In the first scenario, the user is browsing a web page contain-
bodyText ||| ing an embedded video. Upon selecting the âPlayâ button in
bodyText ||| the embedded video player, Sesame brings up a dialog box
bodyText ||| indicating a remote computer is trying to initiate communica-
bodyText ||| tion with a local process, and the user is directed to click a
bodyText ||| button in the dialog box to open Sesame. When clicked, the
bodyText ||| userâs screen rotates to reveal that the process, to which the
bodyText ||| remote system is trying to connect, is the same process that is
bodyText ||| running her web browser. Noting the temporal coincidence
bodyText ||| between selecting the âPlayâ button and the appearance of the
bodyText ||| dialog box, she suspects that the new connection is needed to
bodyText ||| allow the video to play. Unsure if watching the video is
bodyText ||| worth the risk of letting a remote system connect to her
bodyText ||| computer, she hovers over the remote system and observes
bodyText ||| that it is owned by the same company associated with the
bodyText ||| websiteâa company she is familiar with and feels reasona-
bodyText ||| bly comfortable trusting. She clicks the âAllowâ button to
bodyText ||| permit the connection to proceed. However, as she does not
bodyText ||| feel comfortable giving the company free reign to connect to
bodyText ||| her computer, she assigns a permission card allowing the
bodyText ||| connection just once. The yellow connection arrow now
bodyText ||| becomes completely solid and the user clicks the âExit and
bodyText ||| Return to Windowsâ button which rotates her desktop back
bodyText ||| to its normal position and the video plays as expected.
subsubsectionHeader ||| Scenario 2: Is this a phishing site?
bodyText ||| In the second scenario, we begin with a user who is directed
bodyText ||| to a website claiming to be affiliated with their bank. When
bodyText ||| the site asks for personal information, the user becomes
bodyText ||| suspicious and invokes Sesame. Sesame shows the rotated
bodyText ||| desktop allowing the user to see which process is connected
bodyText ||| to their web browser window. They notice that the same
bodyText ||| process is connected to one remote computer. The small map
bodyText ||| shows that the remote computer is located in an unfamiliar
bodyText ||| geography and the name of the owner of the remote com-
bodyText ||| puter seems unrelated to the userâs bank. Still uncertain, the
bodyText ||| user moves their mouse to the remote computer to find out
bodyText ||| more information. When the mouse hovers over the remote
bodyText ||| system, it zooms to show it is associated with an unknown
bodyText ||| domain, and located at an address in a distant country. The
bodyText ||| user becomes concerned that they may not really have visited
bodyText ||| their bankâs website, and therefore closes their browser and
bodyText ||| calls the bank.
sectionHeader ||| IMPLEMENTATION
bodyText ||| Sesame is implemented in C++ and runs on unmodified
bodyText ||| Microsoft Windows XP. All screenshots in this paper were
bodyText ||| taken from live execution of the system. The front-end
page ||| 1050
note ||| CHI 2008 Proceedings Â· Am I Safe	April 5-10, 2008 Â· Florence, Italy
bodyText ||| interface of the system uses the standard windows GDI to
bodyText ||| render most graphics, with GDI+ used for more complex
bodyText ||| effects, such as the gradient fills on the extruded arrows. The
bodyText ||| front-end also includes a series of hooks allowing it to be
bodyText ||| driven from synthetic data sets, as this capability was neces-
bodyText ||| sary for our user study. In order to modify the datasets in real
bodyText ||| time, Sesame registers several global hotkeys allowing us to
bodyText ||| use a second keyboard to control the data Sesame shows to
bodyText ||| study participants. The Sesame front-end gathers process list
bodyText ||| data; the back-end is used to retrieve network status. It also
bodyText ||| includes a simple open-source firewall that is used to inter-
bodyText ||| cept attempts at initiating network connections, and performs
bodyText ||| reverse-DNS and WHOIS lookups to obtain information
bodyText ||| about remote systems. As we did not need complete func-
bodyText ||| tionality for our evaluations, certain backend features related
bodyText ||| to firewall operations, process culling, CPU usage, and
bodyText ||| vender verification were not fully implemented, but were
bodyText ||| mocked up in the front end.
sectionHeader ||| USER STUDY
bodyText ||| We conducted a study to evaluate how well users could
bodyText ||| judge potential security threats using the visualization
bodyText ||| provided by Sesame. Our primary interest was in how well
bodyText ||| users could cumulatively leverage the concepts presented in
bodyText ||| Sesame to make security-related decisions. We chose to
bodyText ||| evaluate these concepts together rather than piecemeal, as the
bodyText ||| experience of our formative study suggested that the differ-
bodyText ||| ent concepts underlying Sesame are heavily interdependent.
bodyText ||| To perform this cumulative evaluation, we asked users to
bodyText ||| make security decisions in an environment with Sesame, as
bodyText ||| well as a more conventional environment using the
bodyText ||| ZoneAlarm firewall instead. To assess usersâ understanding
bodyText ||| of the different ideas in Sesame, we asked various questions
bodyText ||| about different parts of the visualization and about why users
bodyText ||| made particular choices. Note that our focus in this study was
bodyText ||| to understand how the quality of decision-making was
bodyText ||| affected by our visual interface, not on evaluating Sesameâs
bodyText ||| efficiency as a UI (whether it allows faster decision-making),
bodyText ||| or its impact on user motivation (whether it incents people to
bodyText ||| be more active in security management); we leave these as
bodyText ||| future work.
subsectionHeader ||| Participants
bodyText ||| Our study included a total of 20 participants recruited from a
bodyText ||| university campus: 45% female (9 subjects) and 55% male
bodyText ||| (11 subjects). All were undergraduate students; none were
bodyText ||| computer science or computer engineering majors, and none
bodyText ||| considered themselves to be experts in computer operation.
bodyText ||| While those pursuing undergraduate degrees may not ideally
bodyText ||| represent typical users, we found that our participants were
bodyText ||| indeed unfamiliar with basic concepts of computer operation
bodyText ||| such as processes, and security threats such as phishing. We
bodyText ||| therefore felt they were adequately representative. We used
bodyText ||| between-subjects testing, so participants were divided evenly
bodyText ||| between control and experimental groups.
subsectionHeader ||| Security Tasks
bodyText ||| To determine how well participants could identify security
bodyText ||| threats, we gave them several tasks. For each task, they
bodyText ||| effectively had to judge whether a given situation posed a
bodyText ||| security threat. The tasks were based on the types of deci-
bodyText ||| sions users must make in real world use; the first four were
bodyText ||| common personal firewall configuration decisions, the latter
bodyText ||| two required judging the authenticity of websites. The tasks
bodyText ||| included: T1) allow or forbid an incoming connection from
bodyText ||| Microsoft.com after clicking on a video player link; T2)
bodyText ||| allow or forbid an outgoing connection from a spyware
bodyText ||| process named loadsys.exe; T3) allow or forbid an incoming
bodyText ||| connection from a bot server requesting connection with a
bodyText ||| bot process named intmonp.exe; T4) allow or forbid an
bodyText ||| outgoing connection from the process named outlook.exe;
bodyText ||| T5) determine if the website claiming to be Mid America
bodyText ||| Bank is a phishing site; T6) determine if the website claiming
bodyText ||| to be CitiBank is a phishing site. T5 and T6 are intentionally
bodyText ||| similar but whereas T5 represents a threat, T6 does notâthis
bodyText ||| allows us to test for false positives as well as false negatives.
bodyText ||| We balanced the tasks between situations that are triggered
bodyText ||| by user activity (T1, T5, and T6) and those with no direct
bodyText ||| relationship to the userâs actions (T2, T3, and T4).
bodyText ||| Participants performed the security tasks in either the control
bodyText ||| or the experimental environment. The control environment
bodyText ||| was made to reflect the most common configuration used by
bodyText ||| non-experts [15], a typical personal computer with the
bodyText ||| ZoneAlarm firewall. In addition to its ubiquity, we used
bodyText ||| ZoneAlarm in the control because, like Sesame, it provides
bodyText ||| firewall functions and therefore offers many of the same
bodyText ||| actionable controls, and asks many of the same questions, as
bodyText ||| Sesame. It also embodies the textual, indirect interaction
bodyText ||| paradigm employed in most end-user security tools. Further,
bodyText ||| the firewall tasks (T1-T4) were derived from actual prompts
bodyText ||| ZoneAlarm presents to users. Also, rather than use a live
bodyText ||| installation of ZoneAlarm, we made an interactive mockup
bodyText ||| using actual screenshots from ZoneAlarm alertsâthis was to
bodyText ||| ensure that we could control the timing and exact content of
bodyText ||| the dialog boxes. We integrated interactive widgets into our
bodyText ||| mockup as well so that it would behave, as well as appear,
bodyText ||| virtually identical to the actual tool.
bodyText ||| Participants in the experimental group used the same system
bodyText ||| as those in the control, except that Sesame was provided in
bodyText ||| place of ZoneAlarm. Because Sesame offers an unusual user
bodyText ||| interface, we gave participants about 90 seconds to explore it
bodyText ||| before beginning the tasks. We provided no explanation
bodyText ||| about the meaning of Sesameâs behind-the-desktop visual
bodyText ||| elements; we only demonstrated how one could hover over
bodyText ||| and click on some objects to semantically zoom in on them.
bodyText ||| Similarly to ZoneAlarm and other firewalls, for tasks T1-T4,
bodyText ||| Sesame alerted the user to the security situation by bringing
bodyText ||| up a dialog box. From there the user would click a button to
bodyText ||| enter the Sesame UI. For T5-T6, the experimenter explained
bodyText ||| the situation and asked the user to click the always-present
bodyText ||| âOpen Sesameâ button to enter the Sesame interface.
subsectionHeader ||| Study Details
bodyText ||| As each participant began the study, they were asked a series
page ||| 1051
note ||| CHI 2008 Proceedings Â· Am I Safe	April 5-10, 2008 Â· Florence, Italy
bodyText ||| of background questions to assess their familiarity with
bodyText ||| computers and security tools. Before any tasks were pre-
bodyText ||| sented to them, participants were instructed to think aloud
bodyText ||| about what information they would be using in making their
bodyText ||| decisions. All participants used the same Dell laptop with a
bodyText ||| 15â monitor running Windows XP Home edition. An exter-
bodyText ||| nal keyboard was used by the experimenters to bring up the
bodyText ||| alerts for each security task. The participants were asked to
bodyText ||| make security decisions as if the laptop being used was their
bodyText ||| own.
bodyText ||| As discussed above, for the first security task participants
bodyText ||| were asked to download a video from the Microsoft website
bodyText ||| which caused an alert dialog box from the firewall to pop-up.
bodyText ||| After completing the first task, participants were instructed to
bodyText ||| browse to any website of their choosing. They were then
bodyText ||| presented with the next three tasks while they browsed
bodyText ||| online. Upon the completion of each task, the participant
bodyText ||| continued browsing until the next one was presented to them.
bodyText ||| We were careful during these tasks not to cause a popup to
bodyText ||| appear immediately after the user took an action (e.g.,
bodyText ||| clicking a link) so that they would not erroneously think they
bodyText ||| caused the popup in those cases where they did not. For the
bodyText ||| final two tasks, none of the participants were familiar with
bodyText ||| the term âphishing siteâ so a brief explanation was given.
bodyText ||| Since we were assessing the intelligibility of the Sesame
bodyText ||| visualization, we declined to answer participant questions
bodyText ||| about the meanings of Sesameâs visual elements. We asked
bodyText ||| them to infer as best they could with the information given.
bodyText ||| Participants were asked to think aloud during their decision
bodyText ||| making process for the six tasks, in order to aid us in under-
bodyText ||| standing their reasoning processes. Upon completion of all
bodyText ||| tasks participants were asked follow-up questions in a semi-
bodyText ||| structured interview regarding the choices they made. We
bodyText ||| asked about the clarity of the decisions they had to make, the
bodyText ||| choices presented to them and the information provided by
bodyText ||| the security tool they used (i.e., Sesame or ZoneAlarm). We
bodyText ||| also asked for suggestions for improving the security tools.
bodyText ||| Each subject participated in the study individually and was
bodyText ||| voice recorded to capture responses to the interview ques-
bodyText ||| tions and the think aloud.
sectionHeader ||| RESULTS
bodyText ||| For each participant, we gathered the following data: 1)
bodyText ||| background information, 2) the participantâs âmiss-rateâ for
bodyText ||| the six tasks, and 3) responses to follow-up questions regard-
bodyText ||| ing comprehension of the system information provided. We
bodyText ||| define miss-rate to be the number of potential threats the
bodyText ||| participant evaluated erroneously (i.e., judging a threatening
bodyText ||| situation to be safe or vice versa).
bodyText ||| Participant security background: Based on the background
bodyText ||| information gathered, both the control and experimental
bodyText ||| groups were similar in terms of experience with computers
bodyText ||| and security tools. Participants in the control group had an
bodyText ||| average of 10.4 years of experience using the computer and
bodyText ||| only 2 out of 10 participants did not use any security tool
bodyText ||| (e.g. Norton Anti-virus, firewalls or anti-spyware). Similarly,
bodyText ||| participants in the experimental group had an average of 9.2
bodyText ||| years of experience using the computer and 2 out of 10 did
bodyText ||| not use any security tools. Subjects in both groups were
bodyText ||| asked to briefly describe their security practices besides
bodyText ||| using security software.
bodyText ||| Based on the responses in both groups, the majority of the
bodyText ||| participants did not have or could not recall additional
bodyText ||| security practices they performed besides making occasional
bodyText ||| updates to their security software when alerted to do so by
bodyText ||| their tools. Further, it seems that the amount of time spent
bodyText ||| using a computer does not necessarily translate into familiar-
bodyText ||| ity with the system knowledge needed to make security
bodyText ||| decisions. Although participantsâ computer usage averaged
bodyText ||| 9-10 years, all were unfamiliar with basic system-level
bodyText ||| concepts, e.g., processes, network connections.
bodyText ||| Security task miss-rate: Since our data were non-parametric,
bodyText ||| discrete, and did not appear to fit a known distribution, we
bodyText ||| used a two-tailed Mann-Whitney test to determine if the
bodyText ||| difference in the miss-rate between the ZoneAlarm (control)
bodyText ||| and Sesame (experimental) groups was statistically signifi-
bodyText ||| cant. In the table below, we summarize the miss rate for both
bodyText ||| groups of participants:
table ||| 	ZoneAlarm group miss- rate (6 males, 4 females)	Sesame group miss-rate (5 males, 5 females)
table ||| Females	45.8%	25% (with outlier* 30%)
table ||| Males	36%	20%
table ||| Miss-rate	40%	22.2% (with outlier* 26.6%)
table ||| *Outlier miss-rate: 66.7%
tableCaption ||| Table 1. Participant miss-rate for security tasks
bodyText ||| Of the 20 participants, we identified one outlier whose miss-
bodyText ||| rate was 66.7%. During the study, this participant expressed
bodyText ||| concern about completing the tasks because s/he was very
bodyText ||| unfamiliar with the Windows environment given that the
bodyText ||| participantâs primary computer was a Macintosh.
bodyText ||| Cumulatively over all of the tasks, the experimental group
bodyText ||| performed significantly better than the control group. Includ-
bodyText ||| ing the outlier, the miss-rate for the group using Sesame is
bodyText ||| 26.6% while the miss-rate is 40% for the control group
bodyText ||| (Z=1.97, P=0.05). (When the outlier is excluded, the Sesame
bodyText ||| group miss-rate is reduced further to 22.2%, Z=2.53,
bodyText ||| P=0.05). Over just the firewall-like tasks (T1-T4), the
bodyText ||| experimental group using Sesame performed 41 % better than
bodyText ||| the control group; but if the outlier is included, the experi-
bodyText ||| mental group performs just 20% better. However, when tasks
bodyText ||| were considered individually or in smaller sets, we did not
bodyText ||| have statistically significant differences between groups due
bodyText ||| to our relatively small sample size. Figure 6 shows the
bodyText ||| success rates by task, including the outlier.
bodyText ||| Information Comprehension: After the completion of the six
bodyText ||| security tasks, we interviewed participants to understand
bodyText ||| their reactions to the tasks they performed and, for the
bodyText ||| experimental group, to assess how much of Sesame they
bodyText ||| understood. Most of the participants in the control group
bodyText ||| stated that they were uncertain how to use the information
page ||| 1052
note ||| CHI 2008 Proceedings Â· Am I Safe	April 5-10, 2008 Â· Florence, Italy

figure ||| Task (T)
figureCaption ||| Figure 6: Participant hit-rates for security tasks
bodyText ||| provided by ZoneAlarm in making their security decisions.
bodyText ||| Also, many of the participants (seven out of ten) said they
bodyText ||| were following a specific strategy in making allow/deny
bodyText ||| decisions. Five of the seven were either allowing or denying
bodyText ||| every connection request. For example, one participant said
bodyText ||| âI donât want to read all this stuff so Iâm just going to deny
bodyText ||| it. If I allow it, I may have to do something else.â The
bodyText ||| remaining two of the seven allowed or denied based on
bodyText ||| whether they could recognize the process name. Even though
bodyText ||| all the participants had access to a lot of information pro-
bodyText ||| vided by Zone Alarm, only five participants in total looked at
bodyText ||| the process name given to help with their decision. The more
bodyText ||| info button was consistently ignored.
bodyText ||| Cumulatively, as discussed above, the experimental group
bodyText ||| performed significantly better than the control group. One
bodyText ||| contributing factor for this may have been that none of the
bodyText ||| participants reported using a predetermined strategy in
bodyText ||| making decisions. But perhaps more importantly, Sesame
bodyText ||| users appeared to employ more of the information provided
bodyText ||| than the control group in making their allow/deny decisions.
bodyText ||| Sesame users reported using information about the processes
bodyText ||| themselves as well as the remote systems to which they were
bodyText ||| connecting. In contrast, control users tended to rely on
bodyText ||| process names only. We suspect that this may be because
bodyText ||| Sesame provided a more accessible explanation of the
bodyText ||| general significance and specific facts about remote systems.
bodyText ||| For example, five participants found the geography informa-
bodyText ||| tion provided on remote systems to be helpful. Participants
bodyText ||| also reported that the type of language used in Sesame was
bodyText ||| helpful, as well as the permission cards in the allow/deny
bodyText ||| dialog boxâthough it is not clear that the latter specifically
bodyText ||| aided them in performing the tasks.
bodyText ||| To assess the extent to which participants understood the
bodyText ||| conceptual model Sesame provides, we asked them to
bodyText ||| describe the visualization. We specifically inquired about the
bodyText ||| nature of the visual elements such as processes, and about the
bodyText ||| distinction between areas representing things within the
bodyText ||| computer versus outside of the computer. We found that 8 of
bodyText ||| the 10 users understood the basic significance of the cubes
bodyText ||| representing foreground processes. Background processes
bodyText ||| posed a challenge, with only 2 users understanding their
bodyText ||| purpose. We were surprised by this finding, as we explicitly
bodyText ||| included a textual description of the distinction between the
bodyText ||| two types of processes within the UI. The representations of
bodyText ||| the remote computers were understood well, with 8 partici-
bodyText ||| pants recognizing their meaning. Eight participants also
bodyText ||| understood the basic purpose of the arrows connecting
bodyText ||| processes to the remote computers. Finally, 8 of the 10
bodyText ||| participants were also able to identify the areas of the Sesame
bodyText ||| UI that represented things considered to be within the com-
bodyText ||| puter, versus the areas representing things that were âoutsideâ
bodyText ||| the computer.
sectionHeader ||| DISCUSSION AND FUTURE WORK
bodyText ||| The results of our study are encouraging, suggesting that on
bodyText ||| the whole, Sesameâs novel UI helps users make better
bodyText ||| security decisions than with typical security environments
bodyText ||| with a traditional firewall. We were especially pleased that
bodyText ||| our representation could be reasonably well interpreted
bodyText ||| without explanation. E.g., nearly all users understood the
bodyText ||| division between the internal and external regions of the
bodyText ||| designâthis was a particular challenge we faced in earlier
bodyText ||| prototypes. The results suggest our basic representational
bodyText ||| approach to be a viable alternative to conventional textual
bodyText ||| approaches; and that novice users seem to rapidly learn a
bodyText ||| system-level structure when it is framed visually and in terms
bodyText ||| of more familiar concepts as was done in Sesame. While
bodyText ||| there is evidence that Sesameâs visual presentation is more
bodyText ||| effective than traditional firewalls, additional, larger studies
bodyText ||| are needed to confirm this.
bodyText ||| Besides the seemingly successful aspects of Sesame, the
bodyText ||| shortcomings of the UI were also informative. A common
bodyText ||| difficulty for participants was inferring causal relationships.
bodyText ||| Many participants felt that actions they took caused Sesame
bodyText ||| to bring up dialog boxes, even in cases where the Sesame
bodyText ||| visualization itself gave indications to the contrary. Addi-
bodyText ||| tionally, participant comments suggested they often had
bodyText ||| difficulty grasping the idea of their computerâs software
bodyText ||| environment as a collection of quasi-independent causal
bodyText ||| agents, instead inferring strong relationships among the
bodyText ||| different processes. These difficulties suggest that future
bodyText ||| versions of Sesame might use metaphors that better suggest
bodyText ||| the agent-causal nature of processesâsuch as depicting them
bodyText ||| with animated, anthropomorphic figures.
bodyText ||| While we evaluated Sesame as a holistic combination of its
bodyText ||| features, we do believe that there are generalizable design
bodyText ||| principles from our experiences that could be applied to other
bodyText ||| systems.
bodyText ||| First, given our desire to provide a direct manipulation
bodyText ||| interface, swiveling the desktop to show the underlying
bodyText ||| system seemed to be an accessible way to provide context to
bodyText ||| help users understand otherwise hidden features. That there
bodyText ||| are other possible approaches is certain; however, we believe
bodyText ||| that the generalizable principle here is that contextualization
bodyText ||| of new information with familiar, known concepts is a key
bodyText ||| for non-expert use. Our swivel metaphor is one (but not the
bodyText ||| only) way one might accomplish this.
bodyText ||| Second, Sesameâs policy cards provide a persistent visual
bodyText ||| indication of policy settings, allowing them to be easily seen
bodyText ||| and accessed by users in the future. The utility of persistent
bodyText ||| visual indicators âto support awareness of system state, to

bodyText ||| serve as an affordance for reversibility, and so forthâseems
bodyText ||| particularly important for conveying security state, where re-
bodyText ||| accessibility and intelligibility are especially difficult. We
bodyText ||| believe this to be a severe failing of current firewalls, in
bodyText ||| which settingsâonce configuredâare often difficult to re-
bodyText ||| access.
bodyText ||| Third, we believe that metaphorical 3D models may aid in
bodyText ||| helping non-experts understand system information where
bodyText ||| necessary; particularly when it involves concepts underlying
bodyText ||| the desktop metaphor. Such modeling need not be limited to
bodyText ||| a firewall UI. Like file management models (e.g. two file
bodyText ||| folders with pages transferring from one to the other to show
bodyText ||| the status of copying), other system models can be embedded
bodyText ||| in applications, perhaps with individual components rotating
bodyText ||| aside to reveal relevant underlying system information. Our
bodyText ||| study suggests that security information embedded in such a
bodyText ||| model can be effectively leveraged by end-users.
bodyText ||| Finally, Sesame shows the viability of direct manipulation
bodyText ||| (DM) in low level, security and configuration interfaces,
bodyText ||| whereas DM is traditionally only used for windowing and
bodyText ||| within applications. We believe that this area is ripe for the
bodyText ||| use of other specific design techniques from the HCI com-
bodyText ||| munity, such as the use of 2.5D UIâs to extend the desktop
bodyText ||| metaphor. Our work suggests that users can understand
bodyText ||| relationships between different levels of abstraction through
bodyText ||| such well-proved techniques, even when dealing with the
bodyText ||| complex information necessary for security and system
bodyText ||| decision-making.
sectionHeader ||| CONCLUSION
bodyText ||| Sesame brings a direct manipulation graphical interface to
bodyText ||| end-user security to help non-experts make better informed
bodyText ||| security choices. Most prior work in end-user security tended
bodyText ||| to be highly task or threat-specific; or largely text-based
bodyText ||| and/or designed for experts. There are few tools if any which
bodyText ||| focus explicitly on helping non-expert users to better under-
bodyText ||| stand the technical, system-level concepts needed to make
bodyText ||| security decisions. With Sesame, we investigate an approach
bodyText ||| to providing non-experts with a general, firewall-like tool
bodyText ||| that addresses a wider range of threats independent of
bodyText ||| specific tasks or applications.
bodyText ||| Further, we move toward making system-level concepts
bodyText ||| accessible to non-experts by representing them as concrete
bodyText ||| objects and relating them to more familiar concepts such as
bodyText ||| desktop-level objects and real world abstractions like geo-
bodyText ||| graphic locations. In a controlled study, Sesame users were
bodyText ||| more likely to identify security threats accurately than users
bodyText ||| with more typical software environments. Sesame users were
bodyText ||| further able to understand many of the otherwise unfamiliar
bodyText ||| system-level concepts conveyed, suggesting viability to our
bodyText ||| fundamental interface approach. In the future, we plan to
bodyText ||| conduct further studies and explore how better to convey
bodyText ||| those concepts with which users struggled.
