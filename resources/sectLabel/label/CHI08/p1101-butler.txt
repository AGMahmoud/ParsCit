sectionHeader ||| ABSTRACT
bodyText ||| Wikis are sites that support the development of emergent,
bodyText ||| collective infrastructures that are highly flexible and open,
bodyText ||| suggesting that the systems that use them will be
bodyText ||| egalitarian, free, and unstructured. Yet it is apparent that
bodyText ||| the flexible infrastructure of wikis allows the development
bodyText ||| and deployment of a wide range of structures. However, we
bodyText ||| find that the policies in Wikipedia and the systems and
bodyText ||| mechanisms that operate around them are multi-faceted. In
bodyText ||| this descriptive study, we draw on prior work on rules and
bodyText ||| policies in organizations to propose and apply a conceptual
bodyText ||| framework for understanding the natures and roles of
bodyText ||| policies in wikis. We conclude that wikis are capable of
bodyText ||| supporting a broader range of structures and activities than
bodyText ||| other collaborative platforms. Wikis allow for and, in fact,
bodyText ||| facilitate the creation of policies that serve a wide variety of
bodyText ||| functions.

bodyText ||| messy, informal, popularly uncontrolled, non-
bodyText ||| organizational, and radically different from traditional
bodyText ||| organizations [5, 11, 22, 42, 52, 53]. Consistent with this
bodyText ||| characterization, one of the founding principles of
bodyText ||| Wikipedia is âIgnore all rules,â which states that if a rule
bodyText ||| inhibits developing Wikipedia, the contributor should
bodyText ||| ignore it [45].
bodyText ||| Yet examination of the administrative structures of
bodyText ||| Wikipedia reveals a complex structure of rules, processes,
bodyText ||| policies, and roles. There are 44 wiki pages in the
bodyText ||| âWikipedia Official Policyâ category as of September
bodyText ||| 20071. There are 248 wiki pages categorized as âWikipedia
bodyText ||| guidelinesâ which are organized into at least eight
bodyText ||| subcategories. In addition, these do not seem to be
bodyText ||| sufficient, since there are 45 pending proposals for
bodyText ||| guidelines and policies, not to mention the 200 rejected
bodyText ||| proposals for guidelines and policies.
bodyText ||| Even the principle of âIgnore all rules,â labeled as one of
bodyText ||| the official Wikipedia policies, is not immune from such
bodyText ||| âdevelopmentâ [45]. While the âIgnore all rulesâ policy
bodyText ||| itself is only sixteen words long, the page explaining what
bodyText ||| the policy means contains over 500 words, refers readers to
bodyText ||| seven other documents, has generated over 8,000 words of
bodyText ||| discussion, and has been changed over 100 times in less
bodyText ||| than a year.
bodyText ||| Studies of Wikipedia activities [5, 11, 42, 43] and
bodyText ||| anecdotal discussions among participants [49] suggest that
bodyText ||| these policies, rules, and guidelines play an important part
bodyText ||| in both the day-to-day operations and overall success of
bodyText ||| Wikipedia. These arguments are consistent with findings
bodyText ||| and arguments made with regard to other types of online
bodyText ||| collective action, such as online communities [19, 24, 32],
bodyText ||| open source development [15, 16, 26, 41, 44], and virtual
bodyText ||| organizations [1].
bodyText ||| The purpose of this study is to propose a conceptual
bodyText ||| framework for understanding the nature and role of policies
bodyText ||| and rules within wikis. Drawing from prior studies of rules

bodyText ||| and policies in a variety of contexts, including teams,
bodyText ||| traditional organizations, and legal systems [29], different
bodyText ||| images of rules and policies are considered. In each case,
bodyText ||| examples and evidence are drawn from Wikipedia to
bodyText ||| illustrate that view of rules and policies. Following this we
bodyText ||| discuss the implications of the framework for understanding
bodyText ||| both the potential and likely outcomes of wiki efforts and
bodyText ||| design implications of the different perspectives for both
bodyText ||| wiki implementation and development of infrastructures for
bodyText ||| supporting wiki-like initiatives.
sectionHeader ||| RULES, POLICIES AND GUIDELINES
bodyText ||| In the broadest scope, terms like rules, policies, and
bodyText ||| guidelines all refer to the âexplicit and implicit norms,
bodyText ||| regulations, and expectations that regulate the behavior of
bodyText ||| individuals and interactions between themâ [29 p. 5].
bodyText ||| Taken in its most general sense, this definition can also be
bodyText ||| seen as including informal or implicit norms and constraints
bodyText ||| that can significantly affect behavior and interaction, even
bodyText ||| though they are not formally recognized or recorded.
bodyText ||| Given the widely discussed importance of informal norms
bodyText ||| in contexts such as open source projects [35, 41] and other
bodyText ||| online social settings [3, 4], it may be beneficial to equate
bodyText ||| formal and informal rules. In particular this approach
bodyText ||| suggests that insights and results from the study of explicit,
bodyText ||| formal rules and policies may be useful for understanding
bodyText ||| the development, application, and impact of informal rules
bodyText ||| and norms. However, in this study we focus on formal, or
bodyText ||| written, policies, rules, and guidelines.
bodyText ||| We use the terms rules, policies, and guidelines
bodyText ||| interchangeably. While there are some contexts in which
bodyText ||| these are clearly conceptually distinguishable, the
bodyText ||| difference between and application of the terms vary from
bodyText ||| context to context. This suggests that while some aspects
bodyText ||| require distinguishing them from each other, there is not
bodyText ||| ready agreement on what they are or how the terms should
bodyText ||| be used. Furthermore, and for our purposes perhaps more
bodyText ||| importantly, this conceptual equivalence is reflected in the
bodyText ||| Wikipedia definitions which state:
construct ||| âA guideline is any page that is: (1) actionable (i.e. it
construct ||| recommends, or recommends against, an action to be taken
construct ||| by editors) and (2) authorized by consensus. Guidelines are
construct ||| not set in stone and should be treated with common sense
construct ||| and the occasional exception.
construct ||| A policy is similar to a guideline, only more official and
construct ||| less likely to have exceptions.â [48]
bodyText ||| This study focuses on formal written policies for both
bodyText ||| practical and conceptual reasons. Practically, formal rules
bodyText ||| are ideal for study because of the relative ease of
bodyText ||| determining what the policy is, when it was put in place,
bodyText ||| who participated in creating it, when it was referenced, and,
bodyText ||| in some cases, when it was removed. This is particularly
bodyText ||| true in the context of a wiki because of its facilities for
bodyText ||| archiving and managing collaborative documents.
bodyText ||| However, beyond the practical issues, formal written rules
bodyText ||| and policies are significant because of their role as
bodyText ||| boundary objects [33, 34], or as specifications of how the
bodyText ||| content will be used and communication will occur. They
bodyText ||| can serve a variety of purposes by virtue of the fact that
bodyText ||| they are explicit and external. Because they are explicit and
bodyText ||| visible, though, written policies and rules are often sites of
bodyText ||| conflict [29 p. 18]. These same characteristics also mean
bodyText ||| that written policies have greater potential as levers for
bodyText ||| developers, designers, and managers to affect a community
bodyText ||| or collaborative effort [10, 19].
bodyText ||| Hence, while it may be the case that informal norms are
bodyText ||| important, it makes sense to focus on the nature and role of
bodyText ||| formal written rules and policies in the operation of a
bodyText ||| distributed collaborative effort like Wikipedia.
sectionHeader ||| IMAGES AND ROLES OF RULES AND POLICIES
bodyText ||| Because of their centrality in so many aspects of society
bodyText ||| and organizational and individual behaviors, rules and
bodyText ||| policies have been studied by scholars in a wide variety of
bodyText ||| fields, including law, sociology, political science,
bodyText ||| economics, management science, anthropology, linguistics,
bodyText ||| and organizational studies. While these scholars typically
bodyText ||| adopt definitions similar to those described above, the
bodyText ||| assumptions they make about the source, nature, and
bodyText ||| implications of rules and policies can vary significantly.
bodyText ||| While this lack of consensus can present challenges, it also
bodyText ||| provides a basis for characterizing the multifaceted nature
bodyText ||| of rules, policies, and guidelines.
bodyText ||| In particular, prior work provides several perspectives
bodyText ||| which can be used to view rules and policies, including
bodyText ||| rules and policies as:
listItem ||| â¢	Rational efforts to organize and coordinate
listItem ||| â¢	Evolving, competing entities
listItem ||| â¢	Constructions of meaning &amp; identity
listItem ||| â¢	External signals
listItem ||| â¢	Internal signals
listItem ||| â¢	Negotiated settlements and trophies
listItem ||| â¢	Control mechanisms
bodyText ||| In the following sections, we consider each of these
bodyText ||| perspectives. For each one we begin with a discussion of
bodyText ||| the core assumptions that are made about the nature and
bodyText ||| implications of policies playing this role with reference to
bodyText ||| principles and examples drawn from studies of rules in
bodyText ||| traditional organizational and social contexts. We then
bodyText ||| consider examples from Wikipedia that illustrate how the
bodyText ||| policies and guidelines there are consistent with the
bodyText ||| perspective.
bodyText ||| The purpose of these discussions and examples is to
bodyText ||| illustrate how the guidelines and policies in Wikipedia, and
bodyText ||| the systems and mechanisms that operate around them, are
bodyText ||| multi-faceted. As such, these perspectives should not be
page ||| 1102

figureCaption ||| Figure 2. Wikipedia
figureCaption ||| Guideline Box
bodyText ||| treated as a set of mutually exclusive categories, but rather
bodyText ||| as a set of potentially overlapping lenses, each of which
bodyText ||| highlights different aspects of the policies and guidelines
bodyText ||| that exist within Wikipedia.
subsectionHeader ||| Rules and Policies as Rational Efforts to Organize or
subsectionHeader ||| Coordinate
bodyText ||| All groups are faced with challenges created by
bodyText ||| communication and coordination problems which must be
bodyText ||| solved if the shared objectives are to be achieved [7, 13, 14,
bodyText ||| 21, 38, 41]. In this view rules are conscious, intentional
bodyText ||| actions put in place for the purpose of improving collective
bodyText ||| performance. Rules and policies address, or at least
bodyText ||| substantially increase the chance of addressing, the
bodyText ||| problems of communication and coordination by creating a
bodyText ||| context in which distributed actions are taken in reliable
bodyText ||| and consistent ways [27]. In other words, rules and policies
bodyText ||| are means of solving communication and coordination
bodyText ||| problems by increasing the reliability and consistency of
bodyText ||| action (i.e., eliminating the need to explicitly communicate
bodyText ||| and coordinate) [29]. Rules in this role assume that all
bodyText ||| parties have the same motivations and goals.
bodyText ||| Rules and policies for coordination and communication
bodyText ||| have been identified as particularly important in contexts
bodyText ||| where there is high turnover (people coming and going on a
bodyText ||| regular basis), where there is substantial autonomy of
bodyText ||| action, and where explicit coordination is costly and yet
bodyText ||| important to success of the activity [9, 25].
subsubsectionHeader ||| Rational Efforts to Organize or Coordinate in Wikipedia
bodyText ||| Wikipedia has high turnover in that a large majority of the
bodyText ||| editors make only a few changes once, the editors are
bodyText ||| distributed globally, and coordination is necessary in order
bodyText ||| to continuously provide a functioning product (i.e., an
bodyText ||| encyclopedia) on demand.
bodyText ||| For Wikipedia, this perspective
bodyText ||| on rules and policies suggests
bodyText ||| that policies and guidelines are
bodyText ||| being put in place to achieve
bodyText ||| consistency and reliability in
bodyText ||| terms of how things are
bodyText ||| handled and coordinate efforts
bodyText ||| [23], but also to confirm the
bodyText ||| authority of those most likely
bodyText ||| to implement the policies: the
bodyText ||| administrators. For example, a
bodyText ||| policy was created which
bodyText ||| outlines the process which
bodyText ||| should be taken to block a user
bodyText ||| or delete an entry in
bodyText ||| Wikipedia. The 48 policies
bodyText ||| under consideration on the
bodyText ||| Wikipedia Policy proposals
bodyText ||| indicate the administratorsâ continual need to reinforce their
bodyText ||| limited power over the dispersed population of this
bodyText ||| community.
bodyText ||| Because of the decentralized
bodyText ||| nature of the role of user (i.e.,
bodyText ||| editor) in Wikipedia and the high
bodyText ||| turnover, more written policies
bodyText ||| and guidelines are needed to
bodyText ||| facilitate the transfer of
bodyText ||| knowledge [40] from one user to
bodyText ||| the next and maintain
bodyText ||| consistency during the editing.
bodyText ||| Alternatively, fewer policies will
bodyText ||| be specified for administrators
bodyText ||| than users. There are more
bodyText ||| rules, therefore, for editors, since
bodyText ||| their population experiences
bodyText ||| greater turnover and their
bodyText ||| activities are more dispersed
bodyText ||| than those of the administrators
bodyText ||| [13, 14]. Also, since this
bodyText ||| population gains members more
bodyText ||| frequently than the
bodyText ||| administrators, written policies
bodyText ||| assist new people by lending
bodyText ||| them direction with their
bodyText ||| contributions, in a similar
bodyText ||| fashion as Frequently asked
bodyText ||| questions pages in online
bodyText ||| communities [6].
bodyText ||| Most policy and guideline pages
bodyText ||| provide a box with general
bodyText ||| information about Wikipedia
bodyText ||| policy or guidelines,
bodyText ||| respectively, in the prominent
bodyText ||| upper right hand corner, as
bodyText ||| shown in Figures 1 and 2. The
bodyText ||| policies selected for emphasis
bodyText ||| are divided into two sections:
bodyText ||| one discussing procedures for
bodyText ||| editing articles and the other
bodyText ||| reminding users about
bodyText ||| behavioral standards.
bodyText ||| These boxes serve to introduce first time participants to the
bodyText ||| norms of the hybrid community/document paradigm and
bodyText ||| remind more experienced and committed members about
bodyText ||| the essential rules. After all, according to the Wikipedia
bodyText ||| contributors, these policies and guidelines help make
bodyText ||| Wikipedia successful [48]. Also, since the items in these
bodyText ||| lists are links, they point readily to the written document for
bodyText ||| each of these policies.
bodyText ||| Wikipedia editors suggest that policy is often enacted after
bodyText ||| it has been used in practice and recognized as important
bodyText ||| [48], such as to increase the speed, efficiency, or reduce the
bodyText ||| cost of administering the encyclopedia. These enactments
bodyText ||| embody the rational efforts of this role of a policy or
bodyText ||| guideline.

figureCaption ||| Policy Box
page ||| 1103
note ||| CHI 2008 Proceedings Â· Shared Authoring	April 5-10, 2008 Â· Florence, Italy
bodyText ||| A case where a process was âpolicy-fiedâ to accomplish
bodyText ||| these goals is the policy outlining the Criteria for Speedy
bodyText ||| Deletion [50]. The deletion policy is written exclusively for
bodyText ||| administrators, for they are the only community members
bodyText ||| empowered to determine what pages should remain in
bodyText ||| Wikipedia and what pages should be removed. This policy
bodyText ||| is written in extensive form and with multiple categorized
bodyText ||| subsections to accommodate the autonomy of the
bodyText ||| administrators and to support consistency in their decision
bodyText ||| making. Written policies of this sort ensure coordination
bodyText ||| among administrators and prevent arbitrary decisions.
bodyText ||| Additionally, written policies establish guidelines for
bodyText ||| behavior so that each decision does not require the endless
bodyText ||| time expense of lengthy discussion and consensus
bodyText ||| development.
subsubsectionHeader ||| Implications for Rational Efforts to Organize or Coordinate
bodyText ||| Wikipedia policies and guidelines can be seen as intentional
bodyText ||| efforts to solve coordination and communication problems
bodyText ||| by either eliminating the need for direct coordination or
bodyText ||| communication or significantly reducing the costs of such
bodyText ||| communication. Reduction of costs is often achieved by
bodyText ||| codifying the interaction, and hence, reducing the effort
bodyText ||| needed to engage in the exchanges. These mechanisms
bodyText ||| remain important even though communication and
bodyText ||| coordination costs are lower (at least theoretically) because
bodyText ||| of the technology infrastructure due to issues such as
bodyText ||| information overload [17]. At least for large scale wikis,
bodyText ||| such as Wikipedia, the need for organizational mechanisms
bodyText ||| to reduce communication and coordination cost remains.
bodyText ||| Rules and Policies as Evolving, Competing, Self-
bodyText ||| propagating Entities
subsectionHeader ||| Rules can be seen as self-propagating entities that are the
bodyText ||| result of an evolving, competitive process. This perspective
bodyText ||| rejects the idea of intention, design, and agency as the
bodyText ||| primary drivers of policy development, largely because of
bodyText ||| the bounded rationality of individuals and high levels of
bodyText ||| complexity in the organizational system. Instead it is
bodyText ||| argued that rules are the result of competition for shifting
bodyText ||| attention. This results in systems of policies in which
bodyText ||| dynamics of rule development have the following features:
listItem ||| â¢	Rules generate more rules (either exponentially, linearly,
listItem ||| or at a declining rate)
listItem ||| â¢	Areas or problems can be saturated, so modification or
listItem ||| adaptation of rules will drop off as the space gets
listItem ||| âpopulatedâ
listItem ||| â¢	Developing manner rules in one area will draw attention
listItem ||| and people from other areas [29]
subsubsectionHeader ||| Evolving, Competing, Self-propagating Entities in Wikipedia
bodyText ||| For Wikipedia, the basic conditions of this perspective
bodyText ||| definitely apply. Wikipedia is an extremely complex system
bodyText ||| of documents, people, roles, policies and guidelines, yet
bodyText ||| individuals possess bounded rationality [39]. This suggests
bodyText ||| that we should see these kinds of dynamics of rules in the
bodyText ||| formation and modifications of the policies and guidelines
bodyText ||| in Wikipedia, and the archives bear this out.
bodyText ||| One useful measure of increased complexity is the change
bodyText ||| in lengths in terms of word count alone of the policies from
bodyText ||| the first version to most current. All policies studied grew
bodyText ||| enormously.
listItem ||| â¢	Copyrights: 341 words 4 3200 words: 938%
listItem ||| â¢	What Wikipedia is not: 541 words 4 5031 words: 929%
listItem ||| â¢	Civility: 1741 words 4 2131 words: 124%
listItem ||| â¢	Consensus: 132 words 4 2054 words: 1557%
listItem ||| â¢	Deletion: 405 words 4 2349 words: 580%
listItem ||| â¢	Ignore all rules: exceptional case
bodyText ||| The first version of the Ignore all rules policy is only 23
bodyText ||| words long, stating, âIf rules make you nervous and
bodyText ||| depressed, and not desirous of participating in the Wiki,
bodyText ||| then ignore them and go about your businessâ [45]. The
bodyText ||| current version is actually shorter, only 16 words, and says,
bodyText ||| âIf a rule prevents you from working with others to improve
bodyText ||| or maintain Wikipedia, ignore itâ [45]. However, as
bodyText ||| suggested earlier in this paper, while the actual wording of
bodyText ||| this policy declined 69% and it appears on the surface to be
bodyText ||| the least bureaucratic of the policies, the supplemental page
bodyText ||| directly linked to this policy contains 579 words, indicating
bodyText ||| that the policy swelled over 3600% [45].
bodyText ||| The Deletion policy appears to grow less than most of the
bodyText ||| other policies, but this statistic is misleading as the deletion
bodyText ||| policy is continually broken down into smaller
bodyText ||| subcategories in order to prevent discussion of particular
bodyText ||| instances of deletion decisions from appearing on the
bodyText ||| general policy page. The Deletion policy, therefore, is a
bodyText ||| policy of tremendous proliferation and complication.
bodyText ||| Increased complexity is apparent in the Copyrights policy,
bodyText ||| among others, where the diction and syntax emulate that of
bodyText ||| legal documents. The first version of the policy, for
bodyText ||| instance, starts with: âThe goal of Wikipedia is to create
bodyText ||| information that is available to everyone.â The current
bodyText ||| version, starting after a disclaimer note, begins: âThe
bodyText ||| license Wikipedia uses grants free access to our content in
bodyText ||| the same sense as free software is licensed freely.â The
bodyText ||| earlier version uses simple sentence construction and
bodyText ||| vernacular diction. The current one relies on words from the
bodyText ||| legal profession, such as license, grants, access, and later in
bodyText ||| the policy, permission, obligation, rights.
subsubsectionHeader ||| Implications for Evolving, Competing, Self-propagating
subsubsectionHeader ||| Entities
bodyText ||| This role of rules and policies is necessary because it
bodyText ||| attempts to take the complex system that is Wikipedia and
bodyText ||| make it manageable. The evolutionary aspect of this role
bodyText ||| also promotes the continuous updating and modification of
bodyText ||| rules, which is needed in this type of dynamic environment.
subsubsectionHeader ||| Rules and Policies as Constructions of Meaning and
subsubsectionHeader ||| Identity
bodyText ||| Rules and policies answer questions about âwho we areâ
bodyText ||| [29]. They also indicate the way things âshould beâ (i.e.,
bodyText ||| ideals). Lastly they serve to define and exemplify the âtalkâ
page ||| 1104
note ||| CHI 2008 Proceedings Â· Shared Authoring	April 5-10, 2008 Â· Florence, Italy
bodyText ||| of the place. Previous work has looked at the role of shared
bodyText ||| group and community identity [2, 12, 14] and individual
bodyText ||| identity [18, 30, 37] construction.
subsubsectionHeader ||| Constructions of Meaning and Identity in Wikipedia
bodyText ||| For Wikipedia this includes policies that serve the purpose
bodyText ||| of defining what Wikipedia is and is not, either explicitly
bodyText ||| (e.g., What Wikipedia is not page) or through the
bodyText ||| articulation of policy pages on community principles (e.g.,
bodyText ||| Ignore all rules page).
bodyText ||| Meaning and identity are also likely to be reflected in
bodyText ||| discussions of policy changes that center on whether or not
bodyText ||| something is consistent with the âcore principlesâ of
bodyText ||| Wikipedia. An example of these discussions is that which
bodyText ||| centers around the Neutral Point of View policy. This
bodyText ||| policy contains detailed definitions of bias, carefully
bodyText ||| organized guidelines for how to maintain neutrality in an
bodyText ||| article, and specifically outlined procedures for handling
bodyText ||| conflicts [51]. The archived discussion pages on this policy
bodyText ||| are so voluminous that many of them contain the
bodyText ||| discussions held within only one or two days [51].
bodyText ||| The What Wikipedia is not policy sets up a clear sense of
bodyText ||| identity, but less through a description or definition of it
bodyText ||| (i.e., what we are) than through a negative approach. This
bodyText ||| policy is divided into three sections: Style and Format,
bodyText ||| Content, and Community. The first section differentiates
bodyText ||| Wikipedia from printed and published encyclopedias that
bodyText ||| are written by paid experts. The second section defines the
bodyText ||| term encyclopedia. The third one is perhaps the most
bodyText ||| illustrative of the identity of the group, however, for it lays
bodyText ||| out explicitly norms for community behavior, and for the
bodyText ||| purposes of this paper, âWikipedia is not a bureaucracyâ is
bodyText ||| the section most directed towards policy. Interestingly, it
bodyText ||| denies the bureaucratic nature of this organization:
bodyText ||| âWikipedia is not a moot court, and rules are not the
bodyText ||| purpose of the community. Instruction creep should be
bodyText ||| avoided. A perceived procedural error made in posting
bodyText ||| anything, such as an idea or nomination, is not grounds for
bodyText ||| invalidating that post. Follow the spirit, not the letter, of
bodyText ||| any rules, policies and guidelines if you feel they conflict. If
bodyText ||| the rules prevent you from improving the encyclopedia, you
bodyText ||| should ignore them. Disagreements should be resolved
bodyText ||| through consensus-based discussion, rather than through
bodyText ||| tightly sticking to rules and procedures.â
bodyText ||| The irony of this statement is that discussion surrounding
bodyText ||| policy development and modification turns to policy for
bodyText ||| support on a regular basis. The Three-revert rule policy, for
bodyText ||| instance, refers to the Copyrights, Spamming, Non-free
bodyText ||| content, Biographies of living persons, Blocking, and
bodyText ||| Consensus policies in its statement alone, with reference to
bodyText ||| those and other policies and guidelines proliferating
bodyText ||| through the discussion pages.
subsubsectionHeader ||| Implications for Constructions of Meaning and Identity
bodyText ||| Rules in this role allow the wiki and its users to develop a
bodyText ||| sense of identity and meaning, which can be viewed,
bodyText ||| literally and figuratively, by new and current editors. These
bodyText ||| editors can then measure their fit with the community and
bodyText ||| decide on their intended level of participation. For
bodyText ||| example, someone looking for a wiki focused on social
bodyText ||| interaction may not be satisfied with one which focuses on
bodyText ||| purely identity formation [36]. In a volitional environment,
bodyText ||| such statement of meaning, values, and identity can become
bodyText ||| highly influential and rallying.
subsectionHeader ||| Rules and Policies as External Signals
bodyText ||| Sometimes rules are ways of indicating to outside
bodyText ||| stakeholders or concerned parties that things that they care
bodyText ||| about are being attended to. The rules can be symbolic; can
bodyText ||| reflect action, or both. It is possible to discern these
bodyText ||| responses through media coverage of Wikipedia that
bodyText ||| provoked changes in policies or the creation of new ones.
subsubsectionHeader ||| External Signals in Wikipedia
bodyText ||| For Wikipedia, the Copyrights policy illustrates a rule
bodyText ||| acting as an external signal. Based on an analysis of the
bodyText ||| Copyrights guidelines, it appears they were developed in
bodyText ||| response to external complaints or concerns about the
bodyText ||| unpermitted use of protected material [47]. It is perhaps
bodyText ||| because of this external stimulant that this policyâs
bodyText ||| discussion pages, while devoted extensively to copyright
bodyText ||| rules in general, often devolve into discussions of particular
bodyText ||| cases, especially those concerning images [47]. Also,
bodyText ||| perhaps because of the need to signal recognition of an
bodyText ||| issue by Wikipedia, this page developed from a simply
bodyText ||| stated list of rules into a more extensively organized but
bodyText ||| also more linguistically complicated treatise, as mentioned
bodyText ||| above. The language evolved from simple sentence
bodyText ||| structures and vernacular style into the more complicated
bodyText ||| grammars and dictions of the legal profession, possibly due
bodyText ||| to the hiring of general counsel [8], but also as the need for
bodyText ||| greater credibility and as a reflection of the communityâs
bodyText ||| pressures to protect itself and its reputation from outside
bodyText ||| attacks or influences.
bodyText ||| Another example of a policy acting as an external signal, or
bodyText ||| at least being heavily oriented toward external stakeholders,
bodyText ||| is the Biographies of living persons policy [46]. Notable
bodyText ||| characteristics of this policy include:
listItem ||| â¢	It includes full contact information for Jimmy Wales as
listItem ||| the âDesignated Agentâ (which references specific
listItem ||| requirement of US Law) unlike the other policies. It also
listItem ||| includes a link to the Wikimedia Foundations Board of
listItem ||| Trustees in a related readings section.
listItem ||| â¢	It explicitly references external legal structures
listItem ||| requirements (âSuch material requires a high degree of
listItem ||| sensitivity, and must adhere strictly to the law in Florida,
listItem ||| United States and to our content policiesâ). The other
page ||| 1105
note ||| CHI 2008 Proceedings Â· Shared Authoring	April 5-10, 2008 Â· Florence, Italy
listItem ||| policy that turns to this type of language is the Copyrights
listItem ||| policy.
listItem ||| â¢	It uses very insistent language (âEditors must take
listItem ||| particular care...â, â...must adhere strictly to...â
listItem ||| (emphasis in original), or âWe must get the article rightâ
listItem ||| (emphasis in original)).
listItem ||| â¢	In internal discussions, explanations for the policy and
listItem ||| changes to the policy are described in the third person
listItem ||| (they, them, he, her) not first person (we, us, I, me).
listItem ||| â¢	External attention triggers changes to the policy and
listItem ||| concerns of the external stakeholders are one of the
listItem ||| factors referenced in discussions of the policy, such as a
listItem ||| comment on the Biographies of living person page
listItem ||| stating, âI started this due to the Daniel Brandt situation.â
listItem ||| â¢	The policy is referenced in statements to external
listItem ||| stakeholders and media.
bodyText ||| While the Biography of living persons policy is an extreme
bodyText ||| case, which came about because of a very high level of
bodyText ||| external attention to a particular aspect of Wikipedia, other
bodyText ||| examples do exist, such as the sock-puppeting of external
bodyText ||| organizations that edit the content of the entries on them or
bodyText ||| the revelations that editors were not as qualified as they
bodyText ||| claimed.
subsectionHeader ||| Implications for External Signals
bodyText ||| External signals serve the role of demonstrating that the
bodyText ||| wiki and its members recognize an issue as important or
bodyText ||| significant. However, doing this too often can weaken the
bodyText ||| impact or message that an external signal sends to the
bodyText ||| external audience. It is important to note that rules which
bodyText ||| act as external signals speak to external audiences and are
bodyText ||| not necessarily meant for internal audiences, or members.
bodyText ||| Theoretically, a rule which serves only as an external signal
bodyText ||| could be removes and not change the internal dynamic of
bodyText ||| the community.
subsectionHeader ||| Rules and Policies as Internal Signals
bodyText ||| Policies and rules can be used to signal to the community
bodyText ||| what the community finds important, such as creating a
bodyText ||| policy about a particular issue or behavior which is
bodyText ||| significant to the community.
subsubsectionHeader ||| Internal Signals in Wikipedia
bodyText ||| An example of a policy developed as an internal signal is
bodyText ||| the Civility policy. Its function is to promote polite
bodyText ||| interactions between members of the community, rather
bodyText ||| than to recognize or call significance to an issue for an
bodyText ||| external audience. Perhaps as a result of its role, this
bodyText ||| policyâs current form differs from its original form the least
bodyText ||| of all the policies and generates the fewest discussions or
bodyText ||| dissensions. Policies fitting into this category are not
bodyText ||| threatened by outside forces, so their language can remain
bodyText ||| less formal in contrast to rules acting as external signals. As
bodyText ||| such, they also will not serve as the foci of editorial
bodyText ||| pressures faced by those responding to external signals.
bodyText ||| This policy also acts as an internal signal via its prominent
bodyText ||| placement on the list of policies for first-time users [48].
subsubsectionHeader ||| Implications for Internal Signals
bodyText ||| Internal signals demonstrate values and identity to internal
bodyText ||| stakeholders. It is significant to note that while internal
bodyText ||| signals speak to the internal stakeholders, they can be
bodyText ||| triggered by either internal members (e.g. via complaints or
bodyText ||| problematic events) or external viewers.
subsectionHeader ||| Rules and Policies as Negotiated Settlements and
subsectionHeader ||| Trophies
bodyText ||| People have different interests or perspectives. Rules and
bodyText ||| policies are negotiated settlements or trophies. Settlements
bodyText ||| are creating to avoid the cost of continued conflict, while
bodyText ||| trophies are created to give credibility and influence to the
bodyText ||| âwinnerâ in future discussions.
subsubsectionHeader ||| Negotiated Settlements and Trophies in Wikipedia
bodyText ||| In Wikipedia, references to âthat has already been decidedâ
bodyText ||| or references to policy changes as having been determined
bodyText ||| in one sideâs favor or another reflect this perspective. An
bodyText ||| example of this âtrophyâ type situation occurs in the
bodyText ||| Consensus policy. As mentioned previously, extensive
figureCaption ||| Figure 3. Wikipedia consensus flowchart
page ||| 1106
note ||| CHI 2008 Proceedings Â· Shared Authoring	April 5-10, 2008 Â· Florence, Italy
bodyText ||| discussion surrounds the development of written guidelines
bodyText ||| to assist smooth negotiations and to achieve acceptable
bodyText ||| compromises. For the Consensus policy, this type of
bodyText ||| discussion focuses on whether to use specific numbers for
bodyText ||| confirmation of consensus or not. That is, should the group
bodyText ||| need 80% or 75% of the populationâs approval? Or should
bodyText ||| the policy simply state that general agreement is all that is
bodyText ||| required for consensus? An active member wants polling
bodyText ||| results to determine consensus, but he âlosesâ this effort in
bodyText ||| 2005; consensus is explained through the organizational
bodyText ||| structure of the flowchart in Figure 3. In July 2007,
bodyText ||| someone starts adding the numbers requirement back into
bodyText ||| the Consensus policy, and the administrators talk about it
bodyText ||| and remove it each time. In August, there is more
bodyText ||| discussion of consensus versus the supermajority, and then
bodyText ||| it appears that it might be the original participant who lost
bodyText ||| the battle who is adding the numbers back to the policy, and
bodyText ||| even if it is not, he is actively participating in discussions to
bodyText ||| bring back the ânumbersâ [49].
bodyText ||| As an example of the discussion leading away from
bodyText ||| decisions through polling, one administrator says, âfor all
bodyText ||| but uncontroversial trivial propositions, it is unusual for
bodyText ||| decisions on Wikipedia talk pages to operate on a true
bodyText ||| consensus. Instead they operate on a rough consensus
bodyText ||| where it is recognised that a minority are in opposition. The
bodyText ||| question then arises is how large must the majority be to
bodyText ||| ignore the opinions of a minority?â [49].
bodyText ||| When the policy is revised to respect the majority of
bodyText ||| decision makers, the discussion is titled, âThe numbers
bodyText ||| came back again.â The first comment reads, âSo I removed
bodyText ||| them.â The response to it, by the âlosingâ contestant says,
bodyText ||| âDid you not read the section above? There is not
bodyText ||| consensus to remove them,â in an assertion that previous
bodyText ||| decisions support this, but the response to this remark is: âI
bodyText ||| have read the section above. There is clearly no consensus
bodyText ||| to include them. Stop adding them,â reinforcing the
bodyText ||| communityâs adherence to ârough consensusâ as opposed to
bodyText ||| numerically-based decision-making.
subsubsectionHeader ||| Implications for Negotiated Settlements and Trophies
bodyText ||| Policies, therefore, reflect a continuous process of battles
bodyText ||| engaged in and won or lost, so that no conclusion is
bodyText ||| achieved. Much discussion of these policies includes a
bodyText ||| continuous recycling of old fights and unresolved
bodyText ||| contentions.
subsectionHeader ||| Rules and Policies as Control Mechanisms
bodyText ||| To complete tasks and meet goals, rules and policies are
bodyText ||| often written to act as control mechanisms. Control is
bodyText ||| defined as any effort made to ensure appropriate action
bodyText ||| [31]. In the systems development literature, control has
bodyText ||| been defined more specifically from the behavioral sense as
bodyText ||| attempts to ensure that individuals on a project team act in
bodyText ||| accordance with a previously agreed-upon strategy to
bodyText ||| accomplish desired goals and objectives [21]. Control
bodyText ||| mechanisms are âdevices used by controllers to ensure
bodyText ||| proper controllee behaviorâ [20]. Both formal and informal
bodyText ||| control modes rely on control mechanisms to influence
bodyText ||| behavior, but formal modes control via performance
bodyText ||| evaluation and rewards while informal modes control via
bodyText ||| socialization to reduce goal differences [20]. Wikis draw
bodyText ||| upon informal modes of control by writing policies which
bodyText ||| describe ideal work output or behavior.
bodyText ||| Explicitly highlighting this role of rules and policies also
bodyText ||| allows for consideration of ways that rules are used to
bodyText ||| manage divergence of individual and organizational goals, a
bodyText ||| phenomenon that is an important element of organizational
bodyText ||| evolution.
subsubsectionHeader ||| Control Mechanisms in Wikipedia
bodyText ||| Wikipediaâs hierarchy of roles creates a class of people who
bodyText ||| apply the control mechanisms for the group: the
bodyText ||| administrators. Though, it is sometimes claimed that this
bodyText ||| hierarchy does not exist. Administrators are the only ones
bodyText ||| who can, as the Wikipedia site suggests, âprotect and delete
bodyText ||| pages, block other editors, and undo these actions as well.â
bodyText ||| Also, in its categories of policies, Wikipedia devotes an
bodyText ||| entire section to what it calls, âenforcement,â a term for
bodyText ||| controlling the behavior of others. Two in this section that
bodyText ||| require administrator participation are Deletion and
bodyText ||| Blocking. Since control mechanisms ensure consistency
bodyText ||| between the goals and actions of the individual and those of
bodyText ||| the community, and since the goals of individuals are
bodyText ||| sometimes destructive, such as vandalism, a policy like
bodyText ||| Blocking prevents chronic disrupters from damaging the
bodyText ||| group or its efforts. Blocking is the term for the prevention
bodyText ||| of editing rights for those participants who refuse to support
bodyText ||| the goals of the organization. An interesting feature of the
bodyText ||| Blocking policy ameliorates its punitive approach: it is not
bodyText ||| meant for âretaliation,â but instead for âencouragingâ
bodyText ||| appropriate behavior. A control mechanism of this sort,
bodyText ||| therefore, guides normative behavior rather than punishes
bodyText ||| deviance.
bodyText ||| The Three-Revert Rule (called a âruleâ but considered a
bodyText ||| âpolicyâ by Wikipedia) is a community-specific control
bodyText ||| mechanism. It states that an editor may not make more than
bodyText ||| three changes to an encyclopedia page within a twenty-four
bodyText ||| hour period. The stated purpose for this policy is to prevent
bodyText ||| what the group calls âedit wars,&quot; or conflicts between two
bodyText ||| or more editors over an entry that result in the constant
bodyText ||| effort to assert the validity of one version of it over another.
bodyText ||| Administrators established this rule because, as Wikipedia
bodyText ||| founder Jimbo Wales says, ârevert warring has become an
bodyText ||| absurd drain on us.â This control mechanism, therefore,
bodyText ||| protects the administrators from overload created by editors
bodyText ||| who refuse to negotiate about the contents of an entry.
subsubsectionHeader ||| Implications for Control Mechanisms
bodyText ||| Where coordination assumes that all participants in a
bodyText ||| community have the same motives and merely need to
bodyText ||| understand how to get something done in terms of sequence
bodyText ||| or procedure, control suggests to the community what not to
bodyText ||| do and establishes rules of prevention of behaviors that will
bodyText ||| disrupt the process of the organization. These mechanisms
page ||| 1107
note ||| CHI 2008 Proceedings Â· Shared Authoring	April 5-10, 2008 Â· Florence, Italy
bodyText ||| are exceptional, for they can largely be applied only by
bodyText ||| administrators, by those with power acceded to them by the
bodyText ||| group through their demonstrated degree of participation in
bodyText ||| editing and through the acknowledgement of those efforts
bodyText ||| by the other power holders and wielders in the system.
sectionHeader ||| IMPLICATIONS FOR CREATION OF WIKI-BASED
sectionHeader ||| SYSTEMS AND DESIGN OF PLATFORMS
bodyText ||| We suggest, therefore, that pursuing the âpolicylessâ ideal
bodyText ||| that wikis represent is a pipedream. Policy creation and
bodyText ||| maintenance is an important aspect of the work that must be
bodyText ||| done to keep the community running
bodyText ||| Providing tools and infrastructure mechanisms that support
bodyText ||| the development and management of policies is an
bodyText ||| important part of creating social computing systems that
bodyText ||| work. For example, work has been done on policy
bodyText ||| extraction that focuses on identifying rules which can be
bodyText ||| embedded in the infrastructure to support coordination and
bodyText ||| organization. This study suggests that policies vary in their
bodyText ||| intention to support coordination and organization, thus the
bodyText ||| application of the work on policy extraction is narrowed.
bodyText ||| For example, a rule acting as an external signal has less
bodyText ||| intention for coordination and organization. As a result, it
bodyText ||| may not be appropriate for it to be embedded in the
bodyText ||| infrastructure to support coordination and organization.
bodyText ||| Looking at the language used in writing the policy may
bodyText ||| signal its intention to support coordination and organization
bodyText ||| and, subsequently, whether it is a candidate for embedding
bodyText ||| in the infrastructure. More detailed systematic studies can
bodyText ||| provide insight into a policies candidacy for embedding in
bodyText ||| the infrastructure.
bodyText ||| While there is something to be said about treating policies
bodyText ||| as coordination mechanisms that are automated or at least
bodyText ||| embedded directly in the technology, that approach is not
bodyText ||| without its pitfalls. Since policies can also be highly
bodyText ||| symbolic or meaning-filled, embedding them or automating
bodyText ||| them may not work because it could remove this function or
bodyText ||| make it less effective for this purpose. Furthermore, it may
bodyText ||| be possible that different rules playing different roles have
bodyText ||| varying importance for the success of the wiki at specific
bodyText ||| phases in the wiki lifecycle.
bodyText ||| This work raises important questions for organizations
bodyText ||| implementing wikis and collaborative technologies for
bodyText ||| internal use. When organizations invest in these
bodyText ||| technologies, such as Lotus Notes and Microsoft
bodyText ||| Sharepoint, their first step is often to put in place a
bodyText ||| collection of policies and guidelines regarding their use.
bodyText ||| However, less attention is given to the policies and
bodyText ||| guidelines created by the groups that use these systems â
bodyText ||| which are often left to âemergeâ spontaneously. The
bodyText ||| examples and concepts described in this paper highlight the
bodyText ||| complexity of rule formation and suggest that support
bodyText ||| should be provided to help collaborating groups create and
bodyText ||| maintain effective rulespaces.
bodyText ||| Lastly, the Wikipedia archives suggest that facilitating,
bodyText ||| supporting, and managing this system of rules may not be
bodyText ||| simply a matter of data collection. Rather, serving this
bodyText ||| system well is a matter of promoting situational awareness
bodyText ||| and strategic intervention in a complex, evolving system.
sectionHeader ||| CONCLUSIONS
bodyText ||| Wikis have captured the imagination of many because as a
bodyText ||| technology they support unencumbered, highly flexible,
bodyText ||| very visible, and accessible collaboration [5, 11, 22, 42, 52,
bodyText ||| 53]. These features have led many commentators and
bodyText ||| authors to wax eloquently about the possibility of new types
bodyText ||| of work and organization which are peer-based, non-
bodyText ||| hierarchical, non-bureaucratic, emergent, complex, and
bodyText ||| communal.
bodyText ||| While it may be the case that wikis do in fact provide a
bodyText ||| basis for this type of work arrangement, the study reported
bodyText ||| here suggests that the true power of wikis lies in the fact
bodyText ||| that they are a platform that provides affordances which
bodyText ||| allow for a wide variety of rich, multifaceted organizational
bodyText ||| structures. Rather than assuming that rules, policies, and
bodyText ||| guidelines are operating in only one fashion, wikis allow
bodyText ||| for, and in fact facilitate, the creation of policies and
bodyText ||| procedures that serve a wide variety of functions â and as a
bodyText ||| result they are capable of truly supporting a much broader
bodyText ||| range of structures and activities than many of the other
bodyText ||| more structured, collaborative platforms.
bodyText ||| This suggests that not only are wikis a platform that has
bodyText ||| greater potential in organizational and public use, but also
bodyText ||| that, from a design perspective, they provide a valuable
bodyText ||| opportunity for using the âsidewalk design strategyâ of
bodyText ||| providing a field of grass and watching where and how the
bodyText ||| users walk, or so-called desire paths. This study provides a
bodyText ||| basis for describing these paths. Future studies in particular
bodyText ||| applications would do well to ask how these issues are
bodyText ||| addressed, capabilities are used, and how the activities and
bodyText ||| mechanisms that come into play can be helpfully reinforced
bodyText ||| or supported through the interface and infrastructure.
