bodyText ||| Abstract. In this paper, we introduce a unified approach for the adaptive control of 3G mobile networks in order to improve both quality
bodyText ||| of service (QoS) for mobile subscribers and to increase revenue for service providers. The introduced approach constantly monitors QoS
bodyText ||| measures as packet loss probability and the current number of active mobile users during operation of the network. Based on the values
bodyText ||| of the QoS measures just observed, the system parameters of the admission controller and packet scheduler are controlled by the adaptive
bodyText ||| performance management entity. Considering UMTS, we present performance curves showing that handover failure probability is improved
bodyText ||| by more than one order of magnitude. Moreover, the packet loss probability can be effectively regulated to a predefined level and provider
bodyText ||| revenue is significantly increased for all pricing policies.

sectionHeader ||| 1. Introduction
bodyText ||| The third generation (3G) of mobile networks is expected
bodyText ||| to complete the worldwide globalization process of mobile
bodyText ||| communication. Since different parts of the worlds empha-
bodyText ||| size different issues, the global term 3G has regional syn-
bodyText ||| onyms: In the US and Japan, 3G often carries the name In-
bodyText ||| ternational Mobile Telephony 2000 (IMT2000). In Europe,
bodyText ||| 3G has become Universal Mobile Telecommunications Sys-
bodyText ||| tem (UMTS) following the ETSI perspective. The European
bodyText ||| industrial players have created the 3rd Generation Partner-
bodyText ||| ship Project (3GPP) [1] for the standardization of UMTS.
bodyText ||| 3G mobile networks provide the foundation for new services
bodyText ||| with high-rate data not provided by current second generation
bodyText ||| systems [26]. While the standardization of 3G is still ongo-
bodyText ||| ing the discussion of technical issues beyond 3G has already
bodyText ||| started [23,28]. Recently, Aretz et al. reported a vision for
bodyText ||| the future of wireless communication systems beyond 3G that
bodyText ||| consists of a combination of several optimized access systems
bodyText ||| on a common IP-based medium access and core network plat-
bodyText ||| form [5].
bodyText ||| Charging and pricing are essential issues for network op-
bodyText ||| erations of 3G mobile networks. A primary target of differen-
bodyText ||| tiated pricing of Internet services is the prevention of system
bodyText ||| overload and an optimal resource usage according to differ-
bodyText ||| ent daytimes and different traffic intensities [12]. Among the
bodyText ||| proposed pricing proposals, flat-rate pricing [11] is the most
bodyText ||| common mode of payment today for bandwidth services.
bodyText ||| Flat-rate pricing is popular because of its minimal account-
bodyText ||| ing overhead. A flat-rate encourages usage but does not offer
bodyText ||| any motivation for users to adjust their demand. Dynamic
bodyText ||| pricing models that take the state of the network into account
bodyText ||| in the price determination have been proposed as being more

bodyText ||| responsive. Usage-based pricing regulates usage by impos-
bodyText ||| ing a fee based on the amount of data actually sent, whereas
bodyText ||| congestion-sensitive pricing uses a fee based on the current
bodyText ||| state of congestion in the network. Thus, a unified approach
bodyText ||| considering both dynamic pricing and controlling quality of
bodyText ||| service (i.e., performance management) provides an effective
bodyText ||| tool for the operation of 3G mobile networks. However, in
bodyText ||| previous work [8,13,19,21,25] the improvement of Quality of
bodyText ||| Service (QoS) in 3G mobile networks and the optimization
bodyText ||| of mobile service provider revenue has been considered sepa-
bodyText ||| rately.
bodyText ||| The Quality of Service (QoS) concept and architecture for
bodyText ||| UMTS networks specified in [2] provides means for shar-
bodyText ||| ing radio resources among different groups of users accord-
bodyText ||| ing to their individual QoS demands. Furthermore, the con-
bodyText ||| cept of UMTS management and control functions such as
bodyText ||| admission controller and resource manager is roughly out-
bodyText ||| lined. Das et al. proposed a framework for QoS provisioning
bodyText ||| for multimedia services in 3G wireless access networks [8].
bodyText ||| They developed an integrated framework by combining var-
bodyText ||| ious approaches for call admission control, channel reser-
bodyText ||| vation, bandwidth degradation, and bandwidth compaction.
bodyText ||| In [19], we introduced a framework for the adaptive control
bodyText ||| of UMTS networks, which utilizes online monitoring of QoS
bodyText ||| measures (e.g., handover failure and call blocking probabil-
bodyText ||| ities) in order to adjust system parameters of the admission
bodyText ||| controller and the packet scheduler. The presented approach
bodyText ||| is based on a lookup table called the Performance Manage-
bodyText ||| ment Information Base (P-MIB). Entries of the P-MIB have
bodyText ||| to be determined using extensive off-line simulation experi-
bodyText ||| ments to determine optimal parameter configuration for the
bodyText ||| considered scenarios. Given the entries of the P-MIB, we
bodyText ||| showed how to improve QoS for mobile users by periodi-
bodyText ||| cally adjusting system parameters. The practical applicability
bodyText ||| of this approach is limited if the P-MIB comprises many en-
note ||| 210	C. LINDEMANN ET AL.
bodyText ||| tries (i.e., many scenarios have to be considered) because of
bodyText ||| the high computational effort for determining these entries by
bodyText ||| simulation.
bodyText ||| This paper introduces a unified approach for the adaptive
bodyText ||| performance management for 3G mobile networks. As the
bodyText ||| main result of the paper, the introduced approach is based on
bodyText ||| a mathematical framework for the proposed update schemes
bodyText ||| rather than a lookup table. As a consequence, the adaptive
bodyText ||| control mechanism can be adjusted in an intuitive way and
bodyText ||| optimal system parameter configuration can efficiently be de-
bodyText ||| termined. We effectively utilize adaptive performance man-
bodyText ||| agement for improving not only QoS for mobile users but
bodyText ||| also increase revenue earned by service providers. As in [19],
bodyText ||| controlled system parameters comprise queueing weights for
bodyText ||| packet scheduling, a threshold value of the access queue for
bodyText ||| admission of non real-time traffic, and a portion of the over-
bodyText ||| all available bandwidth reserved for handover calls. Be-
bodyText ||| yond [19], we propose a scheme for adjusting the queueing
bodyText ||| weights for both improving QoS for higher priority users that
bodyText ||| suffer from a high population of users with lower priority and
bodyText ||| for increasing the revenue earned by the service provider. For
bodyText ||| the analysis of the update strategy of the queuing weights, we
bodyText ||| consider a usage-based and a usage-/throughput-based pric-
bodyText ||| ing policy according to [11,12,21]. Furthermore, we intro-
bodyText ||| duce a hybrid pricing policy combining the notion of flat-
bodyText ||| rate and a usage-based pricing according to current policies
bodyText ||| of GSM networks. Performance curves derived by simulation
bodyText ||| evidently illustrate the gain of the unified approach for adap-
bodyText ||| tive performance management. In fact, for UMTS networks,
bodyText ||| simulation results show that handover failure probability can
bodyText ||| be improved by more than one order of magnitude. Moreover,
bodyText ||| packet loss probability can be effectively regulated to a prede-
bodyText ||| fined level and the provider revenue is significantly increased
bodyText ||| for all considered pricing policies.
bodyText ||| The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 introduces the
bodyText ||| unified approach for adaptive performance management and
bodyText ||| describes its embedding in the system architecture of 3G mo-
bodyText ||| bile networks. Section 3 introduces strategies for controlling
bodyText ||| the parameters of an admission controller in order to improve
bodyText ||| QoS. Section 4 describes the parameter control of a packet
bodyText ||| scheduler for the combined improvement of both QoS and
bodyText ||| provider revenue. In section 5, we present simulation results
bodyText ||| that illustrate the benefit of employing the proposed approach
bodyText ||| for adaptive performance management. Finally, concluding
bodyText ||| remarks are given.

subsectionHeader ||| 2.1. Description of the unified approach
bodyText ||| This section introduces the unified approach for regularly ad-
bodyText ||| justing system parameters to changing traffic load, packet ar-
bodyText ||| rival pattern or population of users, etc. We consider a cellular
bodyText ||| mobile network in which a different transceiver station serves
bodyText ||| each cell. The purpose of the transceiver station is the modu-

bodyText ||| lation of carrier frequencies and demodulation of signals. Fur-
bodyText ||| thermore, a base station controller (BSC) is considered that is
bodyText ||| responsible for a cluster of cells, i.e., several transceiver sta-
bodyText ||| tions. The BSC manages the radio resources, i.e., schedules
bodyText ||| data packets, and controls handovers inside the cell cluster as
bodyText ||| well as handovers towards and from neighboring cell clusters.
bodyText ||| To improve QoS for mobile users as well as to increase
bodyText ||| revenue earned by service providers, an entity for Adaptive
bodyText ||| Performance Management (APM) is included in a BSC. Fur-
bodyText ||| thermore, a BSC has to be extended by an online performance
bodyText ||| monitoring component that derives QoS measures in a cer-
bodyText ||| tain time window (e.g., handover failure probabilities of mo-
bodyText ||| bile users or packet loss probabilities). These QoS measures
bodyText ||| form a system pattern that is submitted in fixed time intervals
bodyText ||| (i.e., a control period) to the APM entity, which subsequently
bodyText ||| updates corresponding system parameters (i.e., parameters of
bodyText ||| traffic controlling components like the admission controller
bodyText ||| and packet scheduler). Thus, the proposed approach closes
bodyText ||| the loop between network operation and network control. Fig-
bodyText ||| ure 1 shows the system architecture for performance manage-
bodyText ||| ment embedded in a BSC.
subsubsectionHeader ||| 2.1.1. Online performance monitoring
bodyText ||| System parameters of a BSC can be effectively updated by
bodyText ||| monitoring QoS measures, which are immediately affected by
bodyText ||| these parameters. A current value for a QoS measure is deter-
bodyText ||| mined online based on a set of relevant events corresponding
bodyText ||| to this QoS measure (e.g., packet arrivals are relevant events
bodyText ||| for computing packet loss probabilities). The online monitor-
bodyText ||| ing of QoS measures is done by a sliding window technique
bodyText ||| as introduced in [19]. The width of the sliding window over
bodyText ||| time depends on the number of relevant events that are oc-
bodyText ||| curred according to a QoS measure. Upon arrival of a new
bodyText ||| relevant event the sliding window moves in time. At the end
bodyText ||| of a control period the QoS measures are derived for each
bodyText ||| sliding window (e.g., packet loss probability can be derived
bodyText ||| from number of lost packets divided by number of all packet
bodyText ||| arrivals in the sliding window). These QoS measures and the
bodyText ||| number of events occurred in the last control period form the
bodyText ||| system pattern that is transferred to the adaptive performance
bodyText ||| management entity (see figure 1).
note ||| IMPROVING QoS AND PROVIDER REVENUE IN 3G MOBILE NETWORKS	211
bodyText ||| Note that an accurate online monitoring of QoS measures
bodyText ||| requires a specific width for the sliding window. A certain
bodyText ||| number of events representing the history of the QoS mea-
bodyText ||| sure have to be considered to get an expressive measure. On
bodyText ||| the other hand considering a big sliding window prevents the
bodyText ||| APM entity from fast reaction on changing traffic conditions.
bodyText ||| A bigger sliding window contains more history and, thus,
bodyText ||| more events have to be collected to cause a significant change
bodyText ||| in the online monitored QoS measure. This tradeoff between
bodyText ||| accurate online monitoring and fast reaction of the APM to
bodyText ||| changing traffic conditions has to be studied carefully in sev-
bodyText ||| eral experiments to get the optimal width of the sliding win-
bodyText ||| dow for each QoS measure.
subsubsectionHeader ||| 2.1.2. Adaptive performance management
bodyText ||| Whenever a system pattern S = { (P1, n 1) , ... , (Pm, nm )},
bodyText ||| consisting of online monitored QoS measures P1, ... , Pm
bodyText ||| and the numbers of relevant events n1, ... , nm occurred in
bodyText ||| the last control period is transmitted to the APM an up-
bodyText ||| date of the system parameters can be performed. In gen-
bodyText ||| eral, an update of a system parameter σ is made according
bodyText ||| to a function f depending on a subset of the QoS measures
bodyText ||| P1, ... , Pm and the previous value σ(old) of the system pa-
bodyText ||| rameter. Let Pτ(1), ... , Pτ(k), k S m, be the QoS measures
bodyText ||| corresponding to system parameter σ, then the update is made
bodyText ||| if a certain minimum number n(σ) of relevant events occurred
bodyText ||| in the last control period. That is:
equation ||| σ(new) = f (Pτ (1), ... , Pτ(k), σ
equation ||| if min{nτ(1), ... , nτ(k)} n(σ).11 (1)
bodyText ||| We classify update functions in relative functions, that per-
bodyText ||| form a parameter update relative to the old parameter value
bodyText ||| and absolute functions that set the new parameter value in-
bodyText ||| dependent of the old value, i.e., f is independent of σ(old)
bodyText ||| in (1). With relative update functions strong fluctuations of
bodyText ||| the corresponding system parameter in one update step can be
bodyText ||| avoided. In section 3, we study a special class of relative up-
bodyText ||| date functions in order to set the parameters of an admission
bodyText ||| controller. Furthermore, we develop in section 4 an absolute
bodyText ||| update function for adjusting the weights of a weighted fair
bodyText ||| queueing packet scheduler.
subsectionHeader ||| 2.2. Economics and pricing policies in 3G mobile networks
bodyText ||| There are multiple requirements, which should be fulfilled
bodyText ||| for any viable pricing mechanism in multi-service class data
bodyText ||| communication networks [12]. A primary target of differen-
bodyText ||| tiated pricing of Internet services is the prevention of system
bodyText ||| overload and an optimal resource usage according to differ-
bodyText ||| ent daytimes and different traffic intensities. Furthermore, the
bodyText ||| pricing scheme should be implemented in a completely de-
bodyText ||| centralized manner and there should be multiple priorities in
bodyText ||| order to take into account the different QoS required by dif-
bodyText ||| ferent applications and users.
bodyText ||| In general, pricing policies can be partitioned into usage-
bodyText ||| based (pay-as-you-go) pricing, flat-rate (all-you-can-eat)
bodyText ||| pricing, and dynamic pricing. In usage-based pricing poli-
bodyText ||| cies a user is charged according to a connection time or traffic
bodyText ||| volume. Whereas connection based calls (e.g., in GSM) are
bodyText ||| charged by connection time, packet-switched services (e.g., in
bodyText ||| UMTS) are charging the transferred data volume. Dynamic
bodyText ||| pricing models take into account the state of the mobile ra-
bodyText ||| dio network for determining the current price of a service.
bodyText ||| Congestion-sensitive pricing as a particular dynamic pricing
bodyText ||| model has been shown to be more responsive. MacKie-Mason
bodyText ||| and Varian introduced the concept of congestion-sensitive
bodyText ||| pricing in their smart market scheme [21]. Under this model,
bodyText ||| the actual price for each packet is determined based on the
bodyText ||| current state of network congestion. In [25], Rao and Petersen
bodyText ||| discussed the optimal pricing of priority services. Analo-
bodyText ||| gously to the smart market approach, Gupta et al. presented
bodyText ||| a pricing scheme that uses priorities on the packet-level [13].
bodyText ||| They proposed to differentiate Internet traffic according to de-
bodyText ||| lay and loss requirements.
bodyText ||| For the analysis of the update strategy of the queuing
bodyText ||| weights, we consider in section 4 a usage-based and a usage-/
bodyText ||| throughput-based pricing policy according to [11,12,21]. Fur-
bodyText ||| thermore, we introduce a hybrid pricing policy combining the
bodyText ||| notion of flat-rate and a usage-based pricing according to cur-
bodyText ||| rent policies of GSM networks.
sectionHeader ||| 3. Strategies for improving Quality of Service
sectionHeader ||| 3.1. Admission controller
bodyText ||| The proposed approach distinguishes three different types
bodyText ||| of services: circuit-switched services, packet-switched real-
bodyText ||| time services (RT), and packet-switched non real-time ser-
bodyText ||| vices (NRT). Typically, circuit-switched services are voice
bodyText ||| calls from a GSM mobile station. As proposed by 3GPP, RT
bodyText ||| services belong to the conversational and streaming classes
bodyText ||| and NRT services fall into the interactive and background
bodyText ||| classes [2]. The bandwidth available in a cell must be shared
bodyText ||| by calls of these different service classes and the different ser-
bodyText ||| vice requirements have to be met. Before a mobile session
bodyText ||| begins, the user needs to specify its traffic characteristics and
bodyText ||| desired performance requirements by a QoS profile. Then, an
bodyText ||| admission controller decides to accept or reject the users re-
bodyText ||| quest based on the QoS profile and the current network state
bodyText ||| as, e.g., given by queueing length. The purpose of the admis-
bodyText ||| sion controller is to guarantee the QoS requirements of the
bodyText ||| user who requested admission while not violating the QoS
bodyText ||| profiles of already admitted users. The call admission criteria
bodyText ||| will be different for each service class. The QoS profile for
bodyText ||| RT sessions specifies a guaranteed bandwidth to be provided
bodyText ||| for the application in order to meet its QoS requirements. If
bodyText ||| the network cannot satisfy the desired bandwidth, the corre-
bodyText ||| sponding admission request is rejected.
bodyText ||| Data packets arriving at the BSC are queued until they are
bodyText ||| scheduled to be transmitted over the radio link. For NRT ses-
bodyText ||| sions, we consider an admission controller taking into account
bodyText ||| free buffer space in the NRT queue [8]. In order to prevent
bodyText ||| buffer overflow once a call is admitted, the current queue-
bodyText ||| ing length is set against certain buffer availability threshold
note ||| 212	C. LINDEMANN ET AL.
bodyText ||| of the capacity, denoted by η. The admission criteria for
bodyText ||| voice and RT handovers are the same as for new voice calls
bodyText ||| and RT sessions except that additional handover bandwidth
bodyText ||| can be utilized. The analysis of several admission control
bodyText ||| schemes for cellular systems presented in [24] showed that
bodyText ||| the simple reservation scheme (i.e., reserving bandwidth for
bodyText ||| handover calls) performs remarkably well. For simple cellu-
bodyText ||| lar networks, the optimal amount of bandwidth reserved for
bodyText ||| handover calls can be determined by analytical models [14].
bodyText ||| In the model presented here, we denote with bh the portion
bodyText ||| of the overall bandwidth that is exclusively reserved for han-
bodyText ||| dover calls from neighboring cells. The considered admission
bodyText ||| controller does not prioritize NRT handovers over new NRT
bodyText ||| sessions. Further details of the admission controller are given
bodyText ||| in [19].
subsectionHeader ||| 3.2. Adjusting the admission controllerfor QoS improvement
bodyText ||| In this section, we show how to utilize equation (1) for setting
bodyText ||| the parameters η and bh of the admission controller in order to
bodyText ||| reduce packet loss probability and handover failure probabil-
bodyText ||| ity. For updating the system parameters, we split the general
bodyText ||| function introduced in section 2.1 into separate functions each
bodyText ||| depending only on one QoS measure. Let P1, ... , Pk be the
bodyText ||| QoS measures corresponding to a system parameter σ. Then,
bodyText ||| equation (1) can be simplified to
equation ||| σ(new) = f1 (P1) + ··· + fk(Pk) σ (old)
equation ||| k
equation ||| L\σ(new)\R. (2)
bodyText ||| The interpretation of (2) is the following. Each update
bodyText ||| function fi describes the influence that the QoS measure
bodyText ||| Pi should have on the system parameter σ. Subsequently,
bodyText ||| the overall update is performed by computing the arithmetic
bodyText ||| mean of the functions fi multiplied with the old value of the
bodyText ||| system parameter. Note that the value σ(new) must be trun-
bodyText ||| cated at a certain lower bound L and an upper bound R in
bodyText ||| order to guarantee that the computation of σ(new) results in a
bodyText ||| valid value of the system parameter. As basic update function
bodyText ||| we consider a logarithmic linear function of the form:
equation ||| fi (Pi) = mi log Pi + bi. (3)
bodyText ||| The reason for this choice is that we want to consider QoS
bodyText ||| measures like loss probabilities and failure/blocking proba-
bodyText ||| bilities, which are in the range of 10−5 to 1. Therefore, a
bodyText ||| logarithmic shape is more suitable. In previous work [19],
bodyText ||| we have studied update schemes of system parameters of
bodyText ||| an admission controller and a packet scheduler based on a
bodyText ||| lookup table. In order to determine the optimal entries of this
bodyText ||| lookup table extensive off-line simulation experiments have
bodyText ||| been conducted. Applying regression statistics to the entries
bodyText ||| of this lookup table shows that these entries are well repre-
bodyText ||| sented by functions with logarithmic shape. Thus, besides the
bodyText ||| motivation of the update functions given here, their choice
bodyText ||| is to a large extend originated from regression statistics con-
bodyText ||| ducted in earlier work. The strength of the influence of fi on
bodyText ||| σ(new) can be adjusted with the gradient mi. The parameter bi
bodyText ||| can be determined by the following interpretation: suppose
bodyText ||| the desired level of the QoS measure Pi is βi (e.g., the de-
bodyText ||| sired packet loss probability is 0.001). That is, if the online
bodyText ||| measured value of Pi is βi the system parameter σ should
bodyText ||| not be changed in the update step from the point of view of
bodyText ||| measure Pi. Therefore, we chose fi (βi) = 1 and from this
bodyText ||| relation we get bi = 1 − mi log βi. Inserting in equation (3)
bodyText ||| results in the final form of the update function:
equation ||| .fi (Pi) = mi log Pi + 1.	(4)
equation ||| βi
bodyText ||| For ease of notation, we abbreviate the QoS measures han-
bodyText ||| dover failure probability and new call/session blocking prob-
bodyText ||| ability corresponding to voice calls and RT sessions by HFP
bodyText ||| and CBP, respectively. The probability of a packet loss due
bodyText ||| to buffer overflow in the NRT queue is abbreviated by PLP.
bodyText ||| The update strategy according to equations (2)–(4) is justified
bodyText ||| by its intuitive understanding and the performance results pre-
bodyText ||| sented in section 5. The suitability of update functions other
bodyText ||| than (2)–(4), is subject for further study and out of the scope
bodyText ||| of this paper.
subsubsectionHeader ||| 3.2.1. Update of non real-time queue threshold
bodyText ||| Recall that a system parameter update is performed each time
bodyText ||| a system pattern arrives at the APM entity and the minimum
bodyText ||| number of relevant events corresponding to this system para-
bodyText ||| meter is reached. Determining the update for the system para-
bodyText ||| meter η, i.e., determining η(new), is performed corresponding
bodyText ||| to the old value η(old) and the actually observed QoS measure
bodyText ||| PLP. That is:
equation ||| η(new) = f (PLP) · η(old), 0.001 \ η(new) \ 1.	(5)
bodyText ||| The truncation of η(new) at the lower bound guaranties that
bodyText ||| the value does not accumulate near zero for long periods of
bodyText ||| low traffic load. The minimum number of relevant events re-
bodyText ||| quired for an update of η is counted in data volume rather than
bodyText ||| in packet arrivals (in the experiments this number is 5 MB).
bodyText ||| The setting of the gradient m of the corresponding update
bodyText ||| function is derived from a couple of experiments for different
bodyText ||| values of the gradient. We found m = −0.02 to be suitable.
bodyText ||| Choosing a suitable value for the gradient is a similar tradeoff
bodyText ||| as explained for the sliding window size. A large gradient re-
bodyText ||| sults in a fast update of the system parameter in a few number
bodyText ||| of update steps, but also introduces higher fluctuations of the
bodyText ||| system parameter over time. We demonstrate the speed of the
bodyText ||| parameter adjustment in an experiment in section 5. Further-
bodyText ||| more, several experiments for different desired loss values β
bodyText ||| are presented.
subsectionHeader ||| 3.2.2. Update offraction of bandwidth reserved for handover
subsectionHeader ||| The update for the system parameter bh, i.e., determining
equation ||| b(new)
bodyText ||| h, is performed based on the old value and the actually
bodyText ||| observed QoS measures HFP and CBP. That is:
equation ||| b(new)	h= f1(HFP) +2 f2(CBP) ·b(old)
equation ||| h	,
equation ||| 0.001 \ b(new)	h\ R.	(6)
note ||| IMPROVING QoS AND PROVIDER REVENUE IN 3G MOBILE NETWORKS	213
bodyText ||| The value b(hnew) is truncated at a lower bound of 0.1%
bodyText ||| and a certain upper bound R which is a fraction of the over-
bodyText ||| all bandwidth available (in the experiments we fix R = 0.7).
bodyText ||| The truncation at the lower bound is for the same reason as
bodyText ||| explained above. In fact, for computing b(hnew) two QoS mea-
bodyText ||| sures corresponding to the actually observed HFP and CBP
bodyText ||| are taken into account. A high HFP should increase bhnew)
bodyText ||| but this obviously also increases the CBP because less band-
bodyText ||| width is available for new voice calls and RT sessions. There-
bodyText ||| fore, the HFP and the CBP influence the handover bandwidth
bodyText ||| b(hnew). In fact, m1 = −m2 holds in the update functions f1
bodyText ||| and f2. From a couple of experiments for different gradients,
bodyText ||| we found m1 = 0.08 to be suitable. A common assumption
bodyText ||| in cellular networks is to prioritize handover calls over new
bodyText ||| calls. Therefore, the desired handover failure level β1 should
bodyText ||| be smaller than the desired call blocking level β2. According
bodyText ||| to these values the handover bandwidth is slightly increased,
bodyText ||| if HFP is equal to CBP.
bodyText ||| With the presented strategy the parameters of the update
bodyText ||| functions can be chosen in an intuitive way and optimal para-
bodyText ||| meter configuration can efficiently be determined. This is the
bodyText ||| major advantage over the approach based on a Performance
bodyText ||| Management Information Base introduced in [19] which re-
bodyText ||| quires extensive off-line simulation experiments.
sectionHeader ||| 4. Strategies for improving both QoS and provider
sectionHeader ||| revenue
subsectionHeader ||| 4.1. Packet scheduler
bodyText ||| At a BSC responsible for a cluster of cells, data packets from
bodyText ||| various connections arrive and are queued until bandwidth
bodyText ||| for transmission is available. In order to distinguish differ-
bodyText ||| ent priorities for NRT traffic corresponding to the traffic han-
bodyText ||| dling priority defined by 3GPP [2], scheduling algorithms
bodyText ||| like Weighted Round Robin (WRR), Weighted Fair Queue-
bodyText ||| ing (WFQ [9]) or Class Based Queueing (CBQ [10]) have to
bodyText ||| be implemented. An overview of queueing issues for guar-
bodyText ||| anteed performance services can be found in [27]. In WFQ,
bodyText ||| the weights control the amount of traffic a source may de-
bodyText ||| liver relative to other active sources during some period of
bodyText ||| time. From the scheduling algorithm’s point of view, a source
bodyText ||| is considered to be active, if it has data queued in the NRT
bodyText ||| queue. Let B be the overall bandwidth available for NRT
bodyText ||| sessions at time t. For an active source i with weight wi, the
bodyText ||| bandwidth Bi that is allocated to this transfer at time t is given
bodyText ||| by
equation ||| Bi =	wi	 B.(7)
equation ||| 	Ej w j
bodyText ||| In (7) the sum is taken over all active NRT sources j. A class
bodyText ||| based version of WFQ serves packets of each priority class
bodyText ||| according to the weights rather than every active source.
subsectionHeader ||| 4.2. Adjusting the packet schedulerfor QoS and revenue
subsectionHeader ||| improvement
bodyText ||| This section utilizes the proposed approach for the adaptive
bodyText ||| control of the weights of a weighted fair queueing packet
bodyText ||| scheduler in order to improve QoS as well as to increase the
bodyText ||| revenue. The strategy for adjusting the weights combined
bodyText ||| with the introduction of several pricing policies constitutes
bodyText ||| a further contribution of the paper. Recall that the revenue
bodyText ||| earned by a mobile service provider is determined by the
bodyText ||| monthly payment of mobile users as well as by the additional
bodyText ||| usage-based pricing after the monthly amount of data volume
bodyText ||| is consumed. Note, that the monthly subscription rate is only
bodyText ||| relevant for monthly revenue calculations. In this section, we
bodyText ||| consider the revenue improvement in a certain small time pe-
bodyText ||| riod regardless the monthly subscription rates. In section 5,
bodyText ||| we briefly discuss monthly revenue calculation. Let P denote
bodyText ||| the number of different priority classes, i.e., weights of the
bodyText ||| weighted fair queueing scheduler. Define by bi (t) the trans-
bodyText ||| ferred data volume in time t of users of priority i and by ri (t)
bodyText ||| the payment of users of priority i at time t, i.e., the user pays
bodyText ||| for the transferred data volume. We distinguish a pure usage-
bodyText ||| based and a usage-/throughput-based pricing policy:
listItem ||| (a) A user of priority i has a fixed payment pi per kbit during
listItem ||| his session, i.e., ri (t) = pi.
listItem ||| (b) The payment of a user of priority i consists of a fixed part
listItem ||| pi that is increased proportional to the additional through-
listItem ||| put ϕi (t) he received due to the update of the queueing
listItem ||| weights, i.e., ri (t) = pi ϕi (t).
bodyText ||| According to the proposed data volume based pricing with
bodyText ||| respect to different priority classes the revenue function 4) (t)
bodyText ||| is given by
equation ||| 4)(t) = �P ri (t)bi (t). (8)
equation ||| i=1
bodyText ||| The revenue function of equation (8) is utilized in section 5
bodyText ||| for evaluating the strategies for revenue improvement pre-
bodyText ||| sented below.
subsubsectionHeader ||| 4.2.1. Update of WFQ weights
bodyText ||| Recall that packets of NRT users arriving at the BSC are first
bodyText ||| queued until they are scheduled for transfer by a weighted
bodyText ||| fair queueing discipline. Let wi wi+1, i = 1, ... , P − 1,
bodyText ||| be the basic weights of the WFQ scheduler. The update of
bodyText ||| the queueing weights, i.e., determining winew) is made ac-
bodyText ||| cording to an absolute update function depending on the basic
bodyText ||| weights wi and the current number of NRT sessions belong-
bodyText ||| ing to priority i. Therefore, every system pattern that is trans-
bodyText ||| mitted from the online monitoring component to the adaptive
bodyText ||| performance management entity contains the current number
bodyText ||| of active NRT sessions with priority i in the cell. For ease
bodyText ||| of notation, the number of active non real-time sessions with
bodyText ||| priority i is abbreviated by NRTi .
bodyText ||| The idea behind the strategy for revenue improvement is
bodyText ||| to shift the overall utilization of bandwidth for NRT traffic
note ||| 214	C. LINDEMANN ET AL.
bodyText ||| towards higher priority users, which pay more for the trans-
bodyText ||| ferred data volume. Note that the update strategy should be
bodyText ||| conservative in a way that the transfer of packets of low pri-
bodyText ||| ority is not simply blocked if packets of higher priorities are
bodyText ||| arriving, i.e., priority queueing. Assuming that the majority
bodyText ||| of users will buy a cheaper low priority service class, priority
bodyText ||| queueing will leave most users unsatisfied. Therefore, the up-
bodyText ||| date strategy also considers the QoS aspect. The update strat-
bodyText ||| egy concerning the queueing weights is developed according
bodyText ||| to the following premises:
listItem ||| (i) If the number of active NRT users in the cell is the same
listItem ||| for each priority class, i.e., NRTi = NRTj, i =� j,
listItem ||| the weights wi(new) should be set according to the basic
listItem ||| weights wi for i = 1, ... , P.
listItem ||| (ii) Priority classes with low population of users compared
listItem ||| to other classes should be prioritized, i.e., the corre-
listItem ||| sponding weights should be increased.
listItem ||| (iii) The relative ordering of the weights should be preserved
listItem ||| in a strong way, i.e., winew) · (wi/wi+1) · wi+1) for i =
listItem ||| 1,...,P−1.
bodyText ||| Premise (i) constitutes the key of the update strategy. If all
bodyText ||| priority classes have the same population of users the schedul-
bodyText ||| ing should work as in the case without adaptive control of
bodyText ||| the weights. The rationale behind premise (ii) is to priori-
bodyText ||| tize users that are consuming less bandwidth (relative to their
bodyText ||| weights) than users belonging to other classes, i.e., users of
bodyText ||| low population should be made more independent from the
bodyText ||| influence of user classes with higher population. This premise
bodyText ||| constitutes the basic idea for QoS improvement and is demon-
bodyText ||| strated by the following example that considers two priority
bodyText ||| classes, i.e., a high and low priority class. In WFQ the avail-
bodyText ||| able bandwidth is shared among all active users according to
bodyText ||| their weights. That is, if the minority are high priority users,
bodyText ||| the overall bandwidth consumed by these users will suffer
bodyText ||| from a strong influence of low priority users that hold the
bodyText ||| majority. Therefore, increasing the weights for high priority
bodyText ||| users will result in a higher QoS for this user class. Updating
bodyText ||| the weights according to this strategy will result in a schedul-
bodyText ||| ing algorithm somewhere between a WFQ and a class based
bodyText ||| queueing scheduler. In fact, the benefit of both is utilized: the
bodyText ||| fair sharing of the bandwidth of WFQ and the higher band-
bodyText ||| width guarantees for each priority class provided by a class
bodyText ||| based queueing scheduler.
bodyText ||| Preserving the relative ordering of the weights (i.e.,
bodyText ||| premise (iii)) guarantees that QoS for higher priority users
bodyText ||| and, therefore, the provider revenue can only be improved
bodyText ||| due to the adaptive control of the weights. If the intention
bodyText ||| of the update strategy is not primary on improving provider
bodyText ||| revenue the weights can be also set in a weak relation, i.e.,
bodyText ||| w(new)&gt; w(new) This might be useful to increase QoS for
bodyText ||| +1.g Q
bodyText ||| users of low population independent of their priority class.
bodyText ||| With the following algorithm the computation of the weights

bodyText ||| and (iii) hold for the weights set according to equations (9)
bodyText ||| and (10). The iteration starts with setting

bodyText |||  Note that this is only one
bodyText ||| possibility to set the new weights. Any other starting position
bodyText ||| for the iteration is possible and results in a slightly different
bodyText ||| update of the weights. Nevertheless, the algorithms work in
bodyText ||| a similar way, and therefore, we consider only the iteration
bodyText ||| of (9) and (10). If currently no users of priority i are in the
bodyText ||| cell, i.e., NRTi = 0, the algorithm skips the setting of the

subsubsectionHeader ||| 4.2.2. Considering advanced pricing policies
bodyText ||| In pricing policy (b) introduced above, users have to pay an
bodyText ||| additional fee depending on the throughput improvement due
bodyText ||| to the update of the queueing weights. This concept of pric-
bodyText ||| ing indicates strong similarities to the congestion-sensitive
bodyText ||| pricing of the smart market scheme [21], where the actual
bodyText ||| price for each packet is determined based on the current state
bodyText ||| of network congestion. Similarly, in our throughput-based
bodyText ||| pricing policy the throughput of users is determined by their
bodyText ||| willingness-to-pay additional costs (according to their choice
bodyText ||| of priority class) for transmission of packets in a congested
bodyText ||| network. The additional payment is justified because the
bodyText ||| throughput for users of higher priority will be maintained,
bodyText ||| even if more and more users of lower priority attend the cell,
bodyText ||| i.e., the network is currently congested. We describe the rela-
bodyText ||| In equation (11), THRi is the current throughput of class i de-
bodyText ||| rived from the corresponding sliding window and 0 &lt; γ &lt; 1
bodyText ||| is a scaling exponent (e.g., γ = 1/4) that has to be adjusted
bodyText ||| by the service provider for appropriate revenue dimension-
bodyText ||| ing. In order to guarantee that revenue will be only improved,
bodyText ||| ϕi (t) has to be truncated, i.e., ϕi (t) &gt; 1.
bodyText ||| Next, we adjust the weights according to an advanced pric-
bodyText ||| ing policy that adopts ideas, which have been successful in
bodyText ||| existing GSM networks. In GSM networks, the pricing of
bodyText ||| a provided service is as follows: the proposed service is of-
bodyText ||| fered based on a monthly payment for a dedicated amount
note ||| IMPROVING QoS AND PROVIDER REVENUE IN 3G MOBILE NETWORKS	215
bodyText ||| of call time. If a user has consumed this amount of time
bodyText ||| before the end of the month, he has to pay for any further
bodyText ||| use of this service based on a time-dependent accounting.
bodyText ||| This idea can be generalized and extended towards packet-
bodyText ||| switched services in 3G networks. Analogously, a user has
bodyText ||| to pay a monthly charge for a dedicated amount of data vol-
bodyText ||| ume, which can be transferred without further pricing. After
bodyText ||| using up this monthly amount of data, the user has to pay for
bodyText ||| the desired services according to the transferred data volume
bodyText ||| (byte-based). Moreover, analogous to GSM networks a user
bodyText ||| can utilize “unused” data volume, i.e., the unused fraction of
bodyText ||| the prepaid monthly amount of data volume, in subsequent
bodyText ||| months. If the monthly amount of data is unrestricted, this
bodyText ||| pricing would become a flat-rate pricing and if there is no
bodyText ||| monthly payment, the pricing follows a usage-based policy.
bodyText ||| Thus, our pricing policy constitutes a hybrid approach of flat-
bodyText ||| rate and usage-based pricing.
bodyText ||| The update of the queueing weights can now be extended
bodyText ||| in a way that users consuming their monthly amount of data
bodyText ||| are served with a lower priority than users currently paying for
bodyText ||| their data transfer. Therefore, we introduce a new weight w&apos;
bodyText ||| corresponding to the not paying users. The weight w&apos; must
bodyText ||| be sorted in the weights w1, ... , wP and the iterative update
bodyText ||| algorithm (9)–(10) can be applied to the P + 1 weights as
bodyText ||| described above. In order to distinguish not paying users
bodyText ||| with different priorities these users are served by the WFQ
bodyText ||| scheduler with weights w1 , ... , wP relative to w&apos;. That
bodyText ||| is, WFQ is applied to 2 · P weights, i.e., w1, ... , wP and
equation ||| (w&apos;/w) · w1, ... , (w&apos;/w) · wP with w = w1 + · · · + wP.
subsectionHeader ||| 4.3. Implementation issues
bodyText ||| As outlined in section 2.1, the controlled system parameters
bodyText ||| for QoS and revenue improvement, i.e., η, bh, wi, ϕi, con-
bodyText ||| stitute an integral component of the proposed extension to a
bodyText ||| BSC. The adjustment of system parameters is only based on
bodyText ||| implicit information that is directly measured by the online
bodyText ||| monitoring component. Therefore, no additional signaling
bodyText ||| with other BSCs is necessary for updating system parameters.
bodyText ||| The online monitored QoS measures, i.e., PLP, HFP, CBP,
bodyText ||| NRTi , and THRi , can easily be derived and stored within
bodyText ||| the BSC (see figure 1). The PLP can directly be determined
bodyText ||| by counting the number of IP packets, which are lost due to
bodyText ||| buffer overflow in the NRT queue. HFP as well as the CBP is
bodyText ||| determined by the non-admitted handover calls and new calls
bodyText ||| in the admission controller, respectively. Admission, termina-
bodyText ||| tion, and handover of NRT calls enable the profiling of NRTi ,
bodyText ||| the number of non real-time sessions with priority i. More-
bodyText ||| over, the packet scheduler allows the throughput computation
bodyText ||| of NRT users according to their individual priorities. Fur-
bodyText ||| thermore, no time consuming signaling is needed to transfer
bodyText ||| the system pattern inside the BSC because the online perfor-
bodyText ||| mance monitoring component and the performance manage-
bodyText ||| ment entity both reside in the BSC.
bodyText ||| The question arises how call charging can be accomplished
bodyText ||| for the considered pricing policies in 3G mobile networks.
bodyText ||| For pricing policy (a), i.e., a fixed payment per kbit, call
bodyText ||| charging can easily be processed by the subscription manage-
bodyText ||| ment component of the operation subsystem (OSS) by means
bodyText ||| of the call charging mechanism using the home location reg-
bodyText ||| ister (HLR) [1]. Similarly, the hybrid pricing scheme can be
bodyText ||| realized except that the remaining amount of prepaid data vol-
bodyText ||| ume has to be stored in the HLR for charging the transferred
bodyText ||| data volume. Utilizing these existing charging mechanisms,
bodyText ||| no additionally signaling overhead arises for charging data
bodyText ||| services. The throughput-based pricing policy (pricing pol-
bodyText ||| icy (b)) just slightly changes the situation and can easily be
bodyText ||| implemented within the BSC using a local copy of the user’s
bodyText ||| HLR charging data fields. This local data minimizes signal-
bodyText ||| ing overhead of individual user charging. According to the
bodyText ||| transferred data volume and current throughput of the user’s
bodyText ||| bandwidth class, this local charging profile is continuously
bodyText ||| updated. Handovers with changing BSC of response induce
bodyText ||| the transfer of this local charging profile to the new BSC of
bodyText ||| response. Subsequently, these local data have to be updated
bodyText ||| in the HLR for individual user accounting after termination of
bodyText ||| the call. Note, that this transfer of local charging profiles can
bodyText ||| naturally be embedded in the OSS functionality.

subsectionHeader ||| 5.1. Traffic characterization for 3G networks
bodyText ||| For traffic modeling of RT applications we utilize the ap-
bodyText ||| proach proposed in [18], where variable bit rate video traffic
bodyText ||| is modeled in terms of time-discrete M/G/∞ input processes.
bodyText ||| This model is based on measured video streams and ef-
bodyText ||| ficiently captures the correlation structure of the consid-
bodyText ||| ered video traffic applying the time-discrete M/G/∞ input
bodyText ||| process. The generated traffic is transformed utilizing a hy-
bodyText ||| brid Gamma/Pareto numerical transformation in order to cap-
bodyText ||| ture the marginal distribution of the measured traffic stream.
bodyText ||| Subsequently, the synthetically generated traffic is broken
bodyText ||| down to IP packets of a maximum size of 1500 bytes, which
bodyText ||| are uniformly distributed within a given frame-duration of the
bodyText ||| MPEG video sequence comprising of 1/30 s. Note that this
bodyText ||| traffic model does not propose information for modeling RT
bodyText ||| session durations. Therefore, we assume session durations to
bodyText ||| be exponentially distributed (see section 5.2).
bodyText ||| Recent recommendations for modeling NRT traffic and an-
bodyText ||| alytical traffic models for 3G mobile networks are proposed
bodyText ||| in [15,16], respectively. The traffic model is based on real
bodyText ||| measurements conducted at an Internet service provider dial-
bodyText ||| in link, which comprises comparable characteristics of future
bodyText ||| mobile networks [17], i.e., different access speeds, influence
bodyText ||| of the user behavior due to different tariff limits, as well as
bodyText ||| asymmetric up- and downlink traffic. Based on these mea-
bodyText ||| surements a NRT traffic model is conducted, applying the idea
bodyText ||| of the single user traffic model, which describes traffic charac-
bodyText ||| teristics on session-level, connection-level, i.e., application-
bodyText ||| level, and packet-level, respectively. The key insight of this
bodyText ||| modeling approach lies in an appropriate scaling procedure of

bodyText ||| In this context, a bandwidth class denotes the maximum band-
bodyText ||| width capability of future handheld devices. We refer to [15]
bodyText ||| for details of the NRT traffic model, especially for the para-
bodyText ||| meterization of the traffic characteristics.
subsectionHeader ||| 5.2. The simulation environment
bodyText ||| In order to evaluate the proposed approach for adaptive con-
bodyText ||| trol, we developed a simulation environment for a UMTS ac-
bodyText ||| cess network, i.e., a UMTS Terrestrial Radio Access Network
bodyText ||| (UTRAN [3]). The simulator considers a cell cluster com-
bodyText ||| prising of seven hexagonal cells with corresponding trans-
bodyText ||| ceiver stations (i.e., Node B elements), that are managed by
bodyText ||| a base station controller (i.e., a Radio Network Controller,
bodyText ||| RNC). We assume that a mobile user requests a new session
bodyText ||| in a cell according to a Poisson process. When a mobile user
bodyText ||| starts a new session, the session is classified as voice, RT,
bodyText ||| or NRT session, i.e., with the session the user utilizes voice,
bodyText ||| RT, or NRT services mutually exclusive. RT sessions con-
bodyText ||| sist of streaming downlink traffic corresponding to the UMTS
bodyText ||| streaming class specified by 3GPP [2] and NRT sessions con-
bodyText ||| sist of elastic traffic and correspond to the UMTS interactive
bodyText ||| class or background class, respectively. For the year 2010
bodyText ||| an amount of about 50% voice calls is anticipated [26]. We
bodyText ||| assume that one half of the voice calls are served over the fre-
bodyText ||| quency spectrum for traditional GSM services (i.e., 890–915
bodyText ||| and 935–960 MHz) and the second half is served over the new
bodyText ||| frequency spectrum allocated for UMTS. Nevertheless, the
bodyText ||| simulator considers only the new frequency spectrum. There-
bodyText ||| fore, we assume that 25% of the call requests are voice calls
bodyText ||| whereas RT and NRT sessions constitute 15% and 60% of the
bodyText ||| overall arriving requests (see table 1).
bodyText ||| Subsequently, we have to specify the QoS profile for RT
bodyText ||| and NRT sessions. For RT sessions the simulator considers
bodyText ||| two QoS profiles, i.e., a low bandwidth profile comprising of
bodyText ||| a guaranteed bit rate of 64 kbps corresponding to streaming
bodyText ||| audio and a high bandwidth profile comprising of a guaran-
bodyText ||| teed bit rate of 192 kbps corresponding to streaming video.
bodyText ||| According to the RT traffic model presented in section 5. 1, we
bodyText ||| assume that 80% of the RT sessions utilize the low bandwidth
bodyText ||| profile whereas the remaining 20% utilize the high bandwidth
bodyText ||| profile. Following the single user traffic model, NRT ses-
bodyText ||| sions are partitioned according to different bandwidth classes
bodyText ||| as follows: 60% for 64 kbps, 30% for 144 kbps, and 10%
bodyText ||| for 384 kbps, comprising of different priorities (see table 1),
bodyText ||| respectively.
bodyText ||| The amount of time that a mobile user with an ongoing
bodyText ||| session remains within the cell is called dwell time. If the ses-
bodyText ||| sion is still active after the dwell time, a handover toward an
bodyText ||| adjacent cell takes place. The call/session duration is defined
bodyText ||| as the amount of time that the call will be active, assuming it
bodyText ||| completes without being forced to terminate due to handover
bodyText ||| failure. We assume the duration of voice calls and RT ses-
bodyText ||| sions to be exponentially distributed. As proposed in [6], the
bodyText ||| dwell time is modeled by a lognormal distribution. All corre-
bodyText ||| sponding mean values are shown in table 1. A NRT session
bodyText ||| remains active until a specific data volume drawn according to
bodyText ||| a bandwidth-dependent lognormal distribution is transferred.
bodyText ||| To distinguish between NRT traffic classes, the UMTS simu-
bodyText ||| lator implements a WFQ scheduler with three packet priori-
bodyText ||| ties: 1 (high), 2 (normal), and 3 (low) with weights w1 = 4,
bodyText ||| w2 = 2, and w3 = 1. These priorities correspond to the
bodyText ||| traffic handling priority specified by 3GPP. To model the user
bodyText ||| behavior in the cell, the simulator considers the handover flow
bodyText ||| of active mobile users from adjacent cells. The iterative pro-
bodyText ||| cedure introduced in [4] is employed for balancing the incom-
bodyText ||| ing and outgoing handover rates. The iteration is based on the
bodyText ||| assumption that the incoming handover rate of a user class at
bodyText ||| step i + 1 is equal to the corresponding outgoing handover
bodyText ||| rate computed at step i .
subsubsectionHeader ||| 5.2.1. UMTS system model assumptions
bodyText ||| The simulator exactly mimics UMTS system behavior on the
bodyText ||| IP level. The focus is not on studying link level dynam-
bodyText ||| ics. Therefore, we assume a reliable link layer as provided
bodyText ||| by the automatic repeat request (ARQ) mechanism of the
bodyText ||| Radio Link Control (RLC) protocol. As shown in [22] for
bodyText ||| the General Packet Radio Service (GPRS), the ARQ mecha-
bodyText ||| nism is fast enough to recover from packet losses before reli-
bodyText ||| able protocols on higher layers (e.g., TCP) recognize these
bodyText ||| losses due to timer expiration. Thus, a reliable link level
bodyText ||| can be assumed when considering higher layer protocol ac-
bodyText ||| tions (see, e.g., [20]). To accurately model the UMTS radio
bodyText ||| access network, the simulator represents the functionality of
bodyText ||| one radio network controller and seven Node B transceiver
bodyText ||| stations, one for each of the considered cells. Since in the
bodyText ||| end-to-end path, the wireless link is typically the bottleneck,
bodyText ||| and given the anticipated traffic asymmetry, the simulator fo-
bodyText ||| cuses on resource contention in the downlink (i.e., the path
bodyText ||| RNC → Node B → MS) of the radio interface.
bodyText ||| The simulator considers the UTRAN access scheme based
bodyText ||| on Wideband-Code Division Multiple Access (W-CDMA) in
bodyText ||| Frequency Division Duplex mode (FDD) proposed by 3GPP
bodyText ||| [1]. In FDD downlink, a division of the radio frequencies into
note ||| IMPROVING QoS AND PROVIDER REVENUE IN 3G MOBILE NETWORKS	217
bodyText ||| four physical code channels with data rates of 1,920 kbps each
bodyText ||| up to 512 physical code channels with 15 kbps data rates each
bodyText ||| is possible. Therefore, the overall bandwidth that is available
bodyText ||| in one cell is 7,680 kbps. For the channel coding, we assume
bodyText ||| a convolution-coding scheme with coding factor 2. In the ex-
bodyText ||| periments without adaptive control the handover bandwidth
bodyText ||| portion bh is 5% and the NRT queue threshold η is set to 95%.
bodyText ||| The simulation environment was implemented using the sim-
bodyText ||| ulation library CSIM [7]. In a presimulation run the handover
bodyText ||| flow is balanced, for each cell at the boundary of the seven-
bodyText ||| cell cluster. All simulation results are derived with confidence
bodyText ||| level of 95% using the batch means method. The execution
bodyText ||| of a single simulation run requires about 40–60 min of CPU
bodyText ||| time (depending on the call arrival rate) on a dual processor
bodyText ||| Sun Sparc Enterprise with one GByte main memory.
subsubsectionHeader ||| 5.2.2. Implementation of the hybrid pricing policy in the
subsubsectionHeader ||| simulator
bodyText ||| According to the hybrid pricing policy as introduced in sec-
bodyText ||| tion 4.2.2, the user’s overall remaining amount of prepaid data
bodyText ||| volume d out of the user’s monthly data volume D is deter-
bodyText ||| mined at the beginning of a session. Moreover, the remain-
bodyText ||| ing amount of data volume of previous months r is deter-
bodyText ||| mined. For simulation study purposes, this is accomplished
bodyText ||| by choosing the random value d uniformly out of the interval
bodyText ||| [0, kD]. kD captures the monthly amount of data a user typ-
bodyText ||| ically transfers, i.e., a user typically transfers a multiple k of
bodyText ||| the data volume D that is available for a fixed monthly pay-
bodyText ||| ment. The random value r, is sampled according to a uniform
bodyText ||| distribution out of the interval [0, 0.1 D], where 0.1 D mea-
bodyText ||| sures the maximum amount of “unused” data volume of pre-
bodyText ||| vious months. If d exceeds D + r the user has no remaining
bodyText ||| prepaid data volume, including the data volume of the cur-
bodyText ||| rent and the previous months. Otherwise, there is a remaining
bodyText ||| amount of prepaid data volume D + r − d for the considered
bodyText ||| user and additional pricing arises only, if the transferred data
bodyText ||| volume of the user session exceeds D + r − d. Thus, during
bodyText ||| the user session the remaining data volume has to be updated
bodyText ||| according to the actually transferred data.
bodyText ||| In the simulation studies we utilize the proposed hybrid-
bodyText ||| pricing scheme with a prepaid monthly data volume of
bodyText ||| 150 MB. According to the different priority classes 1, 2,
bodyText ||| and 3, the volume-based pricing for transferred data exceed-
bodyText ||| ing the prepaid monthly data volume comprises of 20, 15,
bodyText ||| and 10 cost-units per MB, respectively. Considering the
bodyText ||| changing traffic loads according to the daytime, this approach
bodyText ||| can be refined, by the notion of different pricing for daily peri-
bodyText ||| ods of time. For the parameterization of the typically monthly
bodyText ||| transferred data volume, we assume k = 2. Note that the
bodyText ||| parameterization of the pricing scheme is chosen for demon-
bodyText ||| stration purposes only. Due to the high flexibility of the hy-
bodyText ||| brid pricing scheme, it can be easily extended towards multi-
bodyText ||| ple, concurrent pricing schemes comprising of, e.g., different
bodyText ||| monthly amounts of prepaid data volumes, different payments
bodyText ||| for the individual priority classes, or a pure usage-based pric-
bodyText ||| ing as well as pure flat-rate pricing.

subsectionHeader ||| 5.3. Performance results
bodyText ||| Using simulation experiments, we illustrate the benefit of the
bodyText ||| proposed unified approach for adaptive performance manage-
bodyText ||| ment of UMTS systems. In particular, we show the improve-
bodyText ||| ment of QoS measures and the increase in revenue earned by
bodyText ||| service providers. The presented curves plot the mean values
bodyText ||| of the confidence intervals for the considered QoS measures.
bodyText ||| In almost all figures, the overall call/session arrival rate of
bodyText ||| new mobile users is varied to study the cell under increasing
bodyText ||| load conditions. For ease of notation, results with and without
bodyText ||| adaptive performance management (APM) are abbreviated by
bodyText ||| APM on and APM off, respectively.
bodyText ||| In a first experiment, we investigate the effect of adap-
bodyText ||| tive control on the threshold for the buffer size of the NRT
bodyText ||| queue denoted by η. Figure 2 shows the NRT packet loss
bodyText ||| probability (a) and the average number of NRT users in the
bodyText ||| cell (b) for the UMTS system with and without adaptive con-
bodyText ||| trol. Furthermore, the figures distinguish between different
bodyText ||| desired loss levels β as introduced in section 3.2. We observe
bodyText ||| that the APM achieves a substantially decrease in packet loss
bodyText ||| probability. Moreover, the packet loss probability can be kept
bodyText ||| below a constant level for increasing arrival rates of mobile
bodyText ||| users. Note, that this level slightly differs from the desired
bodyText ||| level of the QoS measure. This is due to the fact that the up-
bodyText ||| date function only decreases the NRT threshold if the online

bodyText ||| measured packet loss probability is greater than 0. There-
bodyText ||| fore, the packet loss probability is in steady state also slightly
bodyText ||| greater than0. Nevertheless, figure 2 shows that the resulting
bodyText ||| packet loss probability can be adjusted quite well. For very
bodyText ||| low arrival rates, the packet loss probability is increased com-
bodyText ||| pared to the case without adaptive control. This is because
bodyText ||| the packet loss probability is below the desired level and q is
bodyText ||| adjusted towards 100%.
bodyText ||| Figure 2(b) shows the average number of NRT users ad-
bodyText ||| mitted in the cell. For all curves, the number of NRT users in
bodyText ||| the cell first increases up to about 70 users for an arrival rate of
bodyText ||| 1.0 arrivals per second. For higher arrival rates the admission
bodyText ||| controller decides to reject requests depending on the choice
bodyText ||| of the NRT threshold. In the case without APM the num-
bodyText ||| ber of NRT users approaches 100 whereas in the cases with
bodyText ||| adaptive control less users are admitted in the cell because
bodyText ||| the threshold parameter q is decreased (e.g., about 80 users
bodyText ||| for 0 = 0.001). For high arrival rates a slightly decrease
bodyText ||| of the average number of NRT users can be observed. This is
bodyText ||| due to the fact that with increasing arrival rate the competition
bodyText ||| between voice, RT and NRT traffic decreases the bandwidth
bodyText ||| capacity available for NRT traffic. Therefore, less NRT users
bodyText ||| are admitted.
bodyText ||| In the experiment presented in figure 3, we study the ab-
bodyText ||| solute number of packet losses observed in one hour for a
bodyText ||| transient scenario, i.e., the arrival rate of new calls is chang-
bodyText ||| ing every hour according to a half day window of a weekly
bodyText ||| usage pattern [15]. The purpose of this experiment is to show
bodyText ||| that the adaptive performance management is fast enough to
bodyText ||| react on changing traffic conditions, i.e., to effectively adjust
bodyText ||| the NRT threshold in order to reduce packet losses. The bars
bodyText ||| shown in figure 3 correspond to the number of packet losses
bodyText ||| for experiments with and without adaptive control. Further-
bodyText ||| more, the figure distinguishes between a desired loss level 0
bodyText ||| of 0.01 and 0.001, respectively. The new call arrival rates con-
bodyText ||| sidered in one hour are depicted above the bars. We conclude
bodyText ||| from figure 3 that for a real-life pattern of changing arrival
bodyText ||| rates the packet losses can be effectively controlled by the
bodyText ||| APM. This justifies the choice of the gradient m = −0.02 in
bodyText ||| the update function for the NRT threshold.
bodyText ||| (b)
figureCaption ||| Figure 4. Impact of adaptive performance management on handover traffic.
bodyText ||| Next, we study the effect of the APM on the handover
bodyText ||| traffic. Figure 4 shows the handover failure probability (a)
bodyText ||| and the new call blocking probability (b) for the UMTS sys-
bodyText ||| tem with and without APM. Similar to figure 2, we distin-
bodyText ||| guish between different desired levels 0 for the handover fail-
bodyText ||| ure probability. The desired level for new call blocking is
bodyText ||| fixed to 0.1. Note, that for controlling the handover band-
bodyText ||| width the desired level 0 can be used only to adjust the de-
bodyText ||| gree of prioritization of handover failure over new call block-
bodyText ||| ing. Distinct from the packet loss probability, it cannot be
bodyText ||| expected to keep the handover failure probability at a con-
bodyText ||| stant level for increasing traffic load. That is for two rea-
bodyText ||| sons: (1) the handover bandwidth is adjusted according to
bodyText ||| two QoS measures that have a contrary influence and (2) the
bodyText ||| increase of the handover bandwidth must be limited by a
bodyText ||| certain portion of the overall available bandwidth (see sec-
bodyText ||| tion 3.2). If this limit is reached handover failures occur
bodyText ||| more frequently for further increasing call arrival rate. These
bodyText ||| two effects can be observed in the curves of figure 4. Nev-
bodyText ||| ertheless, the handover failure probability is improved more
bodyText ||| than one order of magnitude for call arrival rates between
bodyText ||| 0.75 and 1.25 call requests per second and a desired loss
bodyText ||| level 0 = 0.001. When studying the blocking probabil-
bodyText ||| ity of new voice calls and RT sessions (see figure 4(b)),
bodyText ||| we surly observe a higher blocking probability of new calls
bodyText ||| in the case with adaptive control and high arrival rate. In

bodyText ||| fact, almost all call requests are blocked if system load is
bodyText ||| high.
bodyText ||| In a next experiment, we study the impact of NRT users on
bodyText ||| QoS by the adaptive control of the queueing weights as intro-
bodyText ||| duced in section 4.2. Figure 5 plots the average throughput
bodyText ||| per user for each priority class of NRT traffic. As shown in
bodyText ||| table 1, we assume 10% NRT users with high priority, 30%
bodyText ||| with normal priority, and 60% with low priority. Recall, that
bodyText ||| higher priority service is more expensive and, hence, more
bodyText ||| users choose low priority service. If the overall load in the
bodyText ||| cell is very low (i.e., less than 0.3 call arrivals per second)
bodyText ||| each NRT user receives the maximal throughput independent
bodyText ||| of the priority class. However, when the cell load is further
bodyText ||| increased (arrival rates of more than 0.5 arrivals per second),
bodyText ||| throughput for users of all priority classes decreases. The in-
bodyText ||| tention of adaptively controlling the queueing weights is to
bodyText ||| reduce heavy throughput degradation of high priority users
bodyText ||| in this case. The performance increase of high priority users
bodyText ||| and the decrease of low priority users are shown in figure 5.
bodyText ||| Figure 6 plots the bandwidth portion utilized for each prior-
bodyText ||| ity class of NRT traffic. For low arrival rate (i.e., less than
bodyText ||| 0.5 call arrivals per second) NRT users with low priority uti-
bodyText ||| lize the greatest portion of the NRT bandwidth because most
bodyText ||| NRT users have priority low. When the cell load is increased
bodyText ||| (arrival rates of more than 0.5 arrivals per second), the band-

bodyText ||| width will be utilized more and more by high priority users.
bodyText ||| The adaptive control of the WFQ weights decides to intensify
bodyText ||| this effect because users belonging to priority high suffer from
bodyText ||| the high population of low priority users. Figures 5 and 6 are
bodyText ||| derived from simulation runs with ct = 1/2 (see section 4.2).
bodyText ||| In the following experiments, we study the impact of con-
bodyText ||| trolling the queueing weights on the revenue function (see
bodyText ||| equation (8)) for the three proposed pricing policies, i.e.,
bodyText ||| usage-based, usage-/throughput-based, and the hybrid pricing
bodyText ||| policy. From the revenue function the average (steady state)
bodyText ||| provider revenue 0 in the considered cell can be derived. Re-
bodyText ||| call that the available bandwidth for NRT traffic is variable for
bodyText ||| different call arrival rates. Therefore, we consider the revenue
bodyText ||| earned by the provider in one hour per available bandwidth
bodyText ||| unit, i.e., per available kbit, for NRT traffic. Figure 7 shows
bodyText ||| the provider revenue for the usage-based pricing policy (i.e.,
bodyText ||| y = 0) and different values of the exponent ct. As discussed
bodyText ||| in section 4.2, the best revenue improvement will be achieved
bodyText ||| with priority queueing. From the curves we conclude that the
bodyText ||| update strategy increases the revenue in one cell successfully
bodyText ||| for the considered traffic assumptions. Recall that the revenue
bodyText ||| improvement stems from a shift in bandwidth utilization to-
bodyText ||| wards higher priority users (see figure 6) if the population of
bodyText ||| high priority users is low compared to users of lower priority.
bodyText ||| Figure 7(b) shows the revenue improvement for different
bodyText ||| user populations. In the experiment the percentage of high

figureCaption ||| Figure 9. Revenue improvement for hybrid pricing policy.
bodyText ||| priority users among the arriving user requests is varied. The
bodyText ||| remaining users are assumed to be low priority users. Normal
bodyText ||| priority users are not considered in this experiment (i.e., 0%
bodyText ||| normal priority users). This figure shows how the adaptive
bodyText ||| control of the queueing weights works. As expected, for a low
bodyText ||| percentage of high priority users the corresponding weight
bodyText ||| is increased. Therefore, QoS for high priority users and the
bodyText ||| provider revenue is also increased. For more than 50% high
bodyText ||| priority users the revenue is the same as in the case without
bodyText ||| adaptive control. No further revenue improvement is allowed
bodyText ||| because degradation of QoS for low priority users would be
bodyText ||| unacceptable. Considering a weak relation among the weights
bodyText ||| as introduced in section 4.2 would decrease the revenue com-
bodyText ||| pared to the case without adaptive control for more than 50%
bodyText ||| high priority users. This might be useful to increase QoS for
bodyText ||| users of low population independent of their priority class.
bodyText ||| Figure 8 shows the revenue improvement for the usage-/
bodyText ||| throughput-based pricing policy and scaling exponents γ =
bodyText ||| 1/4 and γ = 1/16. In the last experiment we studied the
bodyText ||| revenue improvement for the hybrid pricing policy (see fig-
bodyText ||| ure 9). We assume that half of the arriving users start their
bodyText ||| session in non-paying mode (i.e., k = 2). The curves distin-
bodyText ||| guish between weights w&apos; = 1 and w&apos; = 2 for the non-paying
bodyText ||| users. Furthermore, the revenue for the case with and without
bodyText ||| adaptive control is compared. The curves are derived from
bodyText ||| simulations with γ = 0 and α = 1/2. From the revenue
bodyText ||| curves of figures 7–9 the average monthly revenue can be
bodyText ||| computed considering a daily/weekly usage-pattern and dif-
bodyText ||| ferent splits of call arrival rates of users requesting different
bodyText ||| services (i.e., voice, RT, NRT with different priorities). Com-
bodyText ||| paring the monthly revenue for the pricing policies used in
bodyText ||| figures 7–9 with the monthly revenue for the hybrid pricing
bodyText ||| policy a provider can determine values such as the monthly
bodyText ||| free data volume and monthly payment per user.
sectionHeader ||| 6. Conclusions
bodyText ||| We introduced a unified approach based on a mathematical
bodyText ||| framework for the adaptive performance management of 3G
bodyText ||| mobile networks. Opposed to previous work [8,13,19,21,25],
bodyText ||| the improvement of quality of service (QoS) and the optimiza-
bodyText ||| tion of mobile service provider revenue was considered in an
bodyText ||| integrated way. The unified approach aims at improving both
bodyText ||| QoS for mobile subscribers and increasing revenue earned by
bodyText ||| service providers. System parameters controlled by adaptive
bodyText ||| performance management constitute the portion of bandwidth
bodyText ||| reserved for handovers, the buffer threshold of the queue for
bodyText ||| non real-time traffic, and the weights of a weighted fair queue-
bodyText ||| ing packet scheduler.
bodyText ||| Using the UMTS traffic model of [15] and a simulator on
bodyText ||| the IP level for the UMTS system, we presented performance
bodyText ||| curves for various QoS measures to illustrate the benefit of
bodyText ||| the unified approach for adaptive performance management.
bodyText ||| We introduced update functions that effectively control the
bodyText ||| packet loss probability and the handover failure probability.
bodyText ||| Considering usage-based, usage-/throughput-based, and hy-
bodyText ||| brid pricing policies, we showed that the provider revenue in
bodyText ||| one cell can be significantly increased by the adaptive control
bodyText ||| of the queueing weights.
bodyText ||| Throughout the paper, we considered the services and QoS
bodyText ||| profiles standardized for UMTS. Thus, the proposed approach
bodyText ||| for adaptive control is tailored to UMTS networks. How-
bodyText ||| ever, by considering other services and QoS profiles, the ba-
bodyText ||| sic ideas underlying the unified approach for adaptive perfor-
bodyText ||| mance management can also be applied for the adaptive con-
bodyText ||| trol of other kinds of multi-service IP networks.
