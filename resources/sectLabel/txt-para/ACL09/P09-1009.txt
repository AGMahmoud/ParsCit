Abstract
# Para 6 25
We investigate the task of unsupervised 
constituency parsing from bilingual par-
allel corpora. Our goal is to use bilin-
gual cues to learn improved parsing mod-
els for each language and to evaluate these 
models on held-out monolingual test data. 
We formulate a generative Bayesian model 
which seeks to explain the observed par-
allel data through a combination of bilin-
gual and monolingual parameters. To this 
end, we adapt a formalism known as un-
ordered tree alignment to our probabilistic 
setting. Using this formalism, our model 
loosely binds parallel trees while allow-
ing language-specific syntactic structure. 
We perform inference under this model us-
ing Markov Chain Monte Carlo and dy-
namic programming. Applying this model 
to three parallel corpora (Korean-English, 
Urdu-English, and Chinese-English) we 
find substantial performance gains over 
the CCM model, a strong monolingual 
baseline. On average, across a variety of 
testing scenarios, our model achieves an 
8.8 absolute gain in F-measure. 1

1 Introduction

In this paper we investigate the task of unsuper-
vised constituency parsing when bilingual paral-
lel text is available. Our goal is to improve pars-
ing performance on monolingual test data for each 
language by using unsupervised bilingual cues at 
training time. Multilingual learning has been suc-
cessful for other linguistic induction tasks such as 
lexicon acquisition, morphological segmentation, 
and part-of-speech tagging (Genzel, 2005; Snyder 
and Barzilay, 2008; Snyder et al., 2008; Snyder

et al., 2009). We focus here on the unsupervised 
induction of unlabeled constituency brackets. This 
task has been extensively studied in a monolingual 
setting and has proven to be difficult (Charniak 
and Carroll, 1992; Klein and Manning, 2002).
# Para 49 11
The key premise of our approach is that am-
biguous syntactic structures in one language may 
correspond to less uncertain structures in the other 
language. For instance, the English sentence I 
saw [the student [from MIT]] exhibits the classic 
problem of PP-attachment ambiguity. However, 
its Urdu translation, literally glossed as I [[MIT of] 
student] saw, uses a genitive phrase that may only 
be attached to the adjacent noun phrase. Know-
ing the correspondence between these sentences 
should help us resolve the English ambiguity.
# Para 60 16
One of the main challenges of unsupervised 
multilingual learning is to exploit cross-lingual 
patterns discovered in data, while still allowing 
a wide range of language-specific idiosyncrasies. 
To this end, we adapt a formalism known as un-
ordered tree alignment (Jiang et al., 1995) to 
a probabilistic setting. Under this formalism, 
any two trees can be embedded in an alignment 
tree. This alignment tree allows arbitrary parts 
of the two trees to diverge in structure, permitting 
language-specific grammatical structure to be pre-
served. Additionally, a computational advantage 
of this formalism is that the marginalized probabil-
ity over all possible alignments for any two trees 
can be efficiently computed with a dynamic pro-
gram in linear time.
# Para 76 9
We formulate a generative Bayesian model 
which seeks to explain the observed parallel data 
through a combination of bilingual and mono-
lingual parameters. Our model views each pair 
of sentences as having been generated as fol-
lows: First an alignment tree is drawn. Each 
node in this alignment tree contains either a soli-
tary monolingual constituent or a pair of coupled 
bilingual constituents. For each solitary mono-

lingual constituent, a sequence of part-of-speech 
tags is drawn from a language-specific distribu-
tion. For each pair of coupled bilingual con-
stituents, a pair of part-of-speech sequences are 
drawn jointly from a cross-lingual distribution. 
Word-level alignments are then drawn based on 
the tree alignment. Finally, parallel sentences are 
assembled from these generated part-of-speech se-
quences and word-level alignments.
# Para 97 5
To perform inference under this model, we use 
a Metropolis-Hastings within-Gibbs sampler. We 
sample pairs of trees and then compute marginal-
ized probabilities over all possible alignments us-
ing dynamic programming.
# Para 102 14
We test the effectiveness of our bilingual gram-
mar induction model on three corpora of parallel 
text: English-Korean, English-Urdu and English- 
Chinese. The model is trained using bilingual 
data with automatically induced word-level align-
ments, but is tested on purely monolingual data 
for each language. In all cases, our model out-
performs a state-of-the-art baseline: the Con-
stituent Context Model (CCM) (Klein and Man-
ning, 2002), sometimes by substantial margins. 
On average, over all the testing scenarios that we 
studied, our model achieves an absolute increase 
in F-measure of 8.8 points, and a 19% reduction 
in error relative to a theoretical upper bound.

2 Related Work
# Para 117 11
The unsupervised grammar induction task has 
been studied extensively, mostly in a monolin-
gual setting (Charniak and Carroll, 1992; Stolcke 
and Omohundro, 1994; Klein and Manning, 2002; 
Seginer, 2007). While PCFGs perform poorly on 
this task, the CCM model (Klein and Manning, 
2002) has achieved large gains in performance and 
is among the state-of-the-art probabilistic models 
for unsupervised constituency parsing. We there-
fore use CCM as our basic model of monolingual 
syntax.
# Para 128 10
While there has been some previous work on 
bilingual CFG parsing, it has mainly focused on 
improving MT systems rather than monolingual 
parsing accuracy. Research in this direction was 
pioneered by (Wu, 1997), who developed Inver-
sion Transduction Grammars to capture cross- 
lingual grammar variations such as phrase re- 
orderings. More general formalisms for the same 
purpose were later developed (Wu and Wong, 
1998; Chiang, 2005; Melamed, 2003; Eisner, 
# Para 138 7
2003; Zhang and Gildea, 2005; Blunsom et al., 
2008). We know of only one study which eval-
uates these bilingual grammar formalisms on the 
task of grammar induction itself (Smith and Smith, 
2004). Both our model and even the monolingual 
CCM baseline yield far higher performance on the 
same Korean-English corpus.
# Para 145 14
Our approach is closer to the unsupervised 
bilingual parsing model developed by Kuhn 
(2004), which aims to improve monolingual per-
formance. Assuming that trees induced over paral-
lel sentences have to exhibit certain structural reg-
ularities, Kuhn manually specifies a set of rules 
for determining when parsing decisions in the two 
languages are inconsistent with GIZA++ word- 
level alignments. By incorporating these con-
straints into the EM algorithm he was able to im-
prove performance over a monolingual unsuper-
vised PCFG. Still, the performance falls short of 
state-of-the-art monolingual models such as the 
CCM.
# Para 159 14
More recently, there has been a body of work 
attempting to improve parsing performance by ex-
ploiting syntactically annotated parallel data. In 
one strand of this work, annotations are assumed 
only in a resource-rich language and are projected 
onto a resource-poor language using the parallel 
data (Hwa et al., 2005; Xi and Hwa, 2005). In 
another strand of work, syntactic annotations are 
assumed on both sides of the parallel data, and a 
model is trained to exploit the parallel data at test 
time as well (Smith and Smith, 2004; Burkett and 
Klein, 2008). In contrast to this work, our goal 
is to explore the benefits of multilingual grammar 
induction in a fully unsupervised setting.
# Para 173 7
We finally note a recent paper which uses pa-
rameter tying to improve unsupervised depen-
dency parse induction (Cohen and Smith, 2009). 
While the primary performance gains occur when 
tying related parameters within a language, some 
additional benefit is observed through bilingual ty-
ing, even in the absence of a parallel corpus.

# Para 181 7
We propose an unsupervised Bayesian model for 
learning bilingual syntactic structure using paral-
lel corpora. Our key premise is that difficult-to-
learn syntactic structures of one language may cor-
respond to simpler or less uncertain structures in 
the other language. We treat the part-of-speech 
tag sequences of parallel sentences, as well as their

the order of one of the original tree’s siblings has been reversed. In (iii), only two pairs of nodes have

word-level alignments, as observed data. We ob-
tain these word-level alignments using GIZA++ 
(Och and Ney, 2003).
# Para 198 9
Our model seeks to explain this observed data 
through a generative process whereby two aligned 
parse trees are produced jointly. Though they 
are aligned, arbitrary parts of the two trees are 
permitted to diverge, accommodating language- 
specific grammatical structure. In effect, our 
model loosely binds the two trees: node-to-node 
alignments need only be used where repeated 
bilingual patterns can be discovered in the data.
# Para 207 1
3.1 Tree Alignments
# Para 208 12
We achieve this loose binding of trees by adapting 
unordered tree alignment (Jiang et al., 1995) to a 
probabilistic setting. Under this formalism, any 
two trees can be aligned using an alignment tree. 
The alignment tree embeds the original two trees 
within it: each node is labeled by a pair (x, y), 
(A, y), or (x, A) where x is a node from the first 
tree, y is a node from the second tree, and A is an 
empty space. The individual structure of each tree 
must be preserved under the embedding with the 
exception of sibling order (to allow variations in 
phrase and word order).
# Para 220 9
The flexibility of this formalism can be demon-
strated by two extreme cases: (1) an alignment be-
tween two trees may actually align none of their 
individual nodes, instead inserting an empty space 
A for each of the original two trees’ nodes. (2) 
if the original trees are isomorphic to one an-
other, the alignment may match their nodes ex-
actly, without inserting any empty spaces. See 
Figure 1 for an example. 
# Para 229 1
3.2 Model overview
# Para 230 24
As our basic model of syntactic structure, we 
adopt the Constituent-Context Model (CCM) of 
Klein and Manning (2002). Under this model, 
the part-of-speech sequence of each span in a sen-
tence is generated either as a constituent yield 
— if it is dominated by a node in the tree — 
or otherwise as a distituent yield. For example, 
in the bracketed sentence [John/NNP [climbed/VB 
[the/DT tree/NN]]], the sequence VB DT NN is gen-
erated as a constituent yield, since it constitutes a 
complete bracket in the tree. On the other hand, 
the sequence VB DT is generated as a distituent, 
since it does not. Besides these yields, the con-
texts (two surrounding POS tags) of constituents 
and distituents are generated as well. In this exam-
ple, the context of the constituent VB DT NN would 
be (NNP, #), while the context of the distituent VB 
DT would be (NNP, NN). The CCM model em-
ploys separate multinomial distributions over con-
stituents, distituents, constituent contexts, and dis-
tituent contexts. While this model is deficient — 
each observed subsequence of part-of-speech tags 
is generated many times over — its performance 
is far higher than that of unsupervised PCFGs.
# Para 254 8
Under our bilingual model, each pair of sen-
tences is assumed to have been generated jointly in 
the following way: First, an unlabeled alignment 
tree is drawn uniformly from the set of all such 
trees. This alignment tree specifies the structure 
of each of the two individual trees, as well as the 
pairs of nodes which are aligned and those which 
are not aligned (i.e. paired with a A).
# Para 262 4
For each pair of aligned nodes, a correspond-
ing pair of constituents and contexts are jointly 
drawn from a bilingual distribution. For unaligned 
nodes (i.e. nodes paired with a A in the alignment
# Para 266 1
75
# Para 267 6
tree), a single constituent and context are drawn, 
from language-specific distributions. Distituents 
and their contexts are also drawn from language- 
specific distributions. Finally, word-level align-
ments are drawn based on the structure of the 
alignment tree.
# Para 273 4
In the next two sections, we describe our model 
in more formal detail by specifying the parame-
ters and generative process by which sentences are 
formed.
# Para 277 1
3.3 Parameters
# Para 278 2
Our model employs a number of multinomial dis-
tributions:
# Para 280 1
•	7r�D : over constituent yields of language i,
# Para 281 1
•	7r�D : over distituent yields of language i,
# Para 282 1
•	��D : over constituent contexts of language i,
# Para 283 1
•	��D : over distituent contexts of language i,
# Para 284 3
•	w : over pairs of constituent yields, one from 
the first language and the other from the sec-
ond language,
# Para 287 4
•	Gzpair : over a finite set of integer val-
ues {—m, ... , —2, —1, 0,1, 2, ... , m}, mea-
suring the Giza-score of aligned tree node 
pairs (see below),
# Para 291 1
•	Gznode : over a finite set of integer values
# Para 292 2
{—m, . . ., —2, —1, 01, measuring the Giza- 
score of unaligned tree nodes (see below).
# Para 294 10
The first four distributions correspond exactly to 
the parameters of the CCM model. Parameter w is 
a “coupling parameter” which measures the com-
patibility of tree-aligned constituent yield pairs. 
The final two parameters measure the compatibil-
ity of syntactic alignments with the observed lexi-
cal GIZA++ alignments. Intuitively, aligned nodes 
should have a high density of word-level align-
ments between them, and unaligned nodes should 
have few lexical alignments.
# Para 304 9
More formally, consider a tree-aligned node 
pair (n1, n2) with corresponding yields (y1, y2). 
We call a word-level alignment good if it aligns 
a word in y1 with a word in y2. We call a word- 
level alignment bad if it aligns a word in y1 with 
a word outside y2, or vice versa. The Giza- 
score for (n1, n2) is the number of good word 
alignments minus the number of bad word align-
ments. For example, suppose the constituent my 
# Para 313 11
long name is node-aligned to its Urdu translation 
mera lamba naam. If only the word-pairs my/mera 
and name/naam are aligned, then the Giza-score 
for this node-alignment would be 2. If however, 
the English word long were (incorrectly) aligned 
under GIZA++ to some Urdu word outside the cor-
responding constituent, then the score would drop 
to 1. This score could even be negative if the num-
ber of bad alignments exceeds those that are good. 
Distribution Gzpair provides a probability for these 
scores (up to some fixed absolute value).
# Para 324 8
For an unaligned node n with corresponding 
yield y, only bad GIZA++ alignments are possible, 
thus the Giza-score for these nodes will always be 
zero or negative. Distribution Gznode provides a 
probability for these scores (down to some fixed 
value). We want our model to find tree alignments 
such that both aligned node pairs and unaligned 
nodes have high Giza-score.
# Para 332 1
3.4 Generative Process
# Para 333 4
Now we describe the stochastic process whereby 
the observed parallel sentences and their word- 
level alignments are generated, according to our 
model.
# Para 337 7
As the first step in the Bayesian generative pro-
cess, all the multinomial parameters listed in the 
previous section are drawn from their conjugate 
priors — Dirichlet distributions of appropriate di-
mension. Then, each pair of word-aligned parallel 
sentences is generated through the following pro-
cess:
# Para 344 12
1. A pair of binary trees T1 and T2 along with 
an alignment tree A are drawn according to 
P(T1, T2, A). A is an alignment tree for T1 
and T2 if it can be obtained by the follow-
ing steps: First insert blank nodes (labeled by 
A) into T1 and T2. Then permute the order 
of sibling nodes such that the two resulting 
trees T10 and T20 are identical in structure. Fi-
nally, overlay T10 and T20 to obtain A. We ad-
ditionally require that A contain no extrane-
ous nodes – that is no nodes with two blank 
labels (A, A). See Figure 1 for an example.
# Para 356 3
We define the distribution P(T1, T2, A) to be 
uniform over all pairs of binary trees and their 
alignments.
# Para 359 2
2. For each node in A of the form (n1, A) (i.e. 
nodes in T1 left unaligned by A), draw
# Para 361 1
(i) a constituent yield according to 7r�1 ,
# Para 362 1

# Para 363 1
(ii) a constituent context according to 0C1,
# Para 364 1
(iii) a Giza-score according to Gznode.
# Para 365 2
3. For each node in A of the form (A, n2) (i.e. 
nodes in T2 left unaligned by A), draw
# Para 367 1
(i) a constituent yield according to 7rC2 ,
# Para 368 2
(ii) a constituent context according to 0C2, 
(iii) a Giza-score according to Gznode.
# Para 370 2
4. For each node in A of the form (n1, n2) (i.e. 
tree-aligned node pairs), draw
# Para 372 2
(i) a pair of constituent yields (y1, y2) ac-
cording to:

which is a product of experts combining 
the language specific context-yield dis-
tributions as well as the coupling distri-
bution W with normalization constant Z,
# Para 380 3
(ii) a pair of contexts according to the ap-
propriate language-specific parameters, 
(iii) a Giza-score according to Gzpair.
# Para 383 4
5. For each span in TZ not dominated by a node 
(for each language i E 11, 2}), draw a dis-
tituent yield according to 7r�Z and a distituent 
context according to 0�Z.
# Para 387 3
6. Draw actual word-level alignments consis-
tent with the Giza-scores, according to a uni-
form distribution.
# Para 390 4
In the next section we turn to the problem of 
inference under this model when only the part-
of-speech tag sequences of parallel sentences and 
their word-level alignments are observed.
# Para 394 1
3.5 Inference
# Para 395 2
Given a corpus of paired part-of-speech tag se-
quences (s1, s2) and their GIZA++ alignments
# Para 397 11
g, we would ideally like to predict the set of 
tree pairs (T1, T2) which have highest proba-
bility when conditioned on the observed data:
P(T1, T2Is1, s2, g). We could rewrite this by
explicitly integrating over the yield, context, cou-
pling, Giza-score parameters as well as the align-
ment trees. However, since maximizing this in-
tegral directly would be intractable, we resort to
standard Markov chain sampling techniques. We
use Gibbs sampling (Hastings, 1970) to draw trees
for each sentence conditioned on those drawn for
# Para 408 3
all other sentences. The samples form a Markov 
chain which is guaranteed to converge to the true 
joint distribution over all sentences.
# Para 411 10
In the monolingual setting, there is a well- 
known tree sampling algorithm (Johnson et al., 
2007). This algorithm proceeds in top-down fash-
ion by sampling individual split points using the 
marginal probabilities of all possible subtrees. 
These marginals can be efficiently pre-computed 
and form the “inside” table of the famous Inside- 
Outside algorithm. However, in our setting, trees 
come in pairs, and their joint probability crucially 
depends on their alignment.
# Para 421 15
For the i1h parallel sentence, we wish to jointly 
sample the pair of trees (T1,T2)Z together with 
their alignment AZ. To do so directly would in-
volve simultaneously marginalizing over all pos-
sible subtrees as well as all possible alignments 
between such subtrees when sampling upper-level 
split points. We know of no obvious algorithm 
for computing this marginal. We instead first sam-
ple the pair of trees (T1, T2)Z from a simpler pro-
posal distribution Q. Our proposal distribution as-
sumes that no nodes of the two trees are aligned 
and therefore allows us to use the recursive top- 
down sampling algorithm mentioned above. After 
a new tree pair T* _ (T1*, T2* )Z is drawn from Q, 
we accept the pair with the following probability:
# Para 436 1
� �
# Para 437 1
min 1,
# Para 438 1
P(T* T—Z, A—Z) Q(TIT—Z, A—Z)
# Para 439 1
P(T IT—Z, A—Z) Q(T* IT—Z, A—Z)
# Para 440 7
where T is the previously sampled tree-pair for 
sentence i, P is the true model probability, and 
Q is the probability under the proposal distribu-
tion. This use of a tractable proposal distribution 
and acceptance ratio is known as the Metropolis- 
Hastings algorithm and it preserves the conver-
gence guarantee of the Gibbs sampler (Hastings,
# Para 447 2
1970). To compute the terms P(T*IT—Z,A—Z) 
and P(T IT—Z, A—Z) in the acceptance ratio above,
# Para 449 2
we need to marginalize over all possible align-
ments between tree pairs.
# Para 451 10
Fortunately, for any given pair of trees T1 and 
T2 this marginalization can be computed using 
a dynamic program in time O (I T1 I I T2 I) . Here 
we provide a very brief sketch. For every pair 
of nodes n1 E T1, n2 E T2, a table stores the 
marginal probability of the subtrees rooted at n1 
and n2, respectively. A dynamic program builds 
this table from the bottom up: For each node pair 
n1, n2, we sum the probabilities of all local align-
ment configurations, each multiplied by the appro-
# Para 461 1
77
# Para 462 5
priate marginals already computed in the table for 
lower-level node pairs. This algorithm is an adap-
tation of the dynamic program presented in (Jiang 
et al., 1995) for finding minimum cost alignment 
trees (Fig. 5 of that publication).
# Para 467 9
Once a pair of trees (T1, T2) has been sam-
pled, we can proceed to sample an alignment tree 
AIT1, T2.2 We sample individual alignment deci-
sions from the top down, at each step using the 
alignment marginals for the remaining subtrees 
(already computed using the afore-mentioned dy-
namic program). Once the triple (T1, T2, A) has 
been sampled, we move on to the next parallel sen-
tence.
# Para 476 13
We avoid directly sampling parameter val-
ues, instead using the marginalized closed forms 
for multinomials with Dirichlet conjugate-priors 
using counts and hyperparameter pseudo-counts 
(Gelman et al., 2004). Note that in the case of 
yield pairs produced according to Distribution 1 
(in step 4 of the generative process) conjugacy is 
technically broken, since the yield pairs are no 
longer produced by a single multinomial distribu-
tion. Nevertheless, we count the produced yields 
as if they had been generated separately by each 
of the distributions involved in the numerator of 
Distribution 1.
# Para 489 1
4 Experimental setup
# Para 490 11
We test our model on three corpora of bilin-
gual parallel sentences: English-Korean, English- 
Urdu, and English-Chinese. Though the model is 
trained using parallel data, during testing it has ac-
cess only to monolingual data. This set-up ensures 
that we are testing our model’s ability to learn bet-
ter parameters at training time, rather than its abil-
ity to exploit parallel data at test time. Following 
(Klein and Manning, 2002), we restrict our model 
to binary trees, though we note that the alignment 
trees do not follow this restriction.
# Para 501 8
Data The Penn Korean Treebank (Han et al., 
2002) consists of 5,083 Korean sentences trans-
lated into English for the purposes of language 
training in a military setting. Both the Korean 
and English sentences are annotated with syntactic 
trees. We use the first 4,000 sentences for training 
and the last 1,083 sentences for testing. We note 
that in the Korean data, a separate tag is given for

2Sampling the alignment tree is important, as it provides 
us with counts of aligned constituents for the coupling pa-
rameter. 
# Para 512 17
each morpheme. We simply concatenate all the 
morpheme tags given for each word and treat the 
concatenation as a single tag. This procedure re-
sults in 199 different tags. The English-Urdu par-
allel corpus3 consists of 4,325 sentences from the 
first three sections of the Penn Treebank and their 
Urdu translations annotated at the part-of-speech 
level. The Urdu side of this corpus does not pro-
vide tree annotations so here we can test parse ac-
curacy only on English. We use the remaining 
sections of the Penn Treebank for English test-
ing. The English-Chinese treebank (Bies et al., 
2007) consists of 3,850 Chinese newswire sen-
tences translated into English. Both the English 
and Chinese sentences are annotated with parse 
trees. We use the first 4/5 for training and the final 
1/5 for testing.
# Para 529 11
During preprocessing of the corpora we remove 
all punctuation marks and special symbols, fol-
lowing the setup in previous grammar induction 
work (Klein and Manning, 2002). To obtain lex-
ical alignments between the parallel sentences we 
employ GIZA++ (Och and Ney, 2003). We use in-
tersection alignments, which are one-to-one align-
ments produced by taking the intersection of one-
to-many alignments in each direction. These one- 
to-one intersection alignments tend to have higher 
precision.
# Para 540 5
We initialize the trees by making uniform split 
decisions recursively from the top down for sen-
tences in both languages. Then for each pair of 
parallel sentences we randomly sample an initial

Baseline We implement a Bayesian version of 
the CCM as a baseline. This model uses the same 
inference procedure as our bilingual model (Gibbs 
sampling). In fact, our model reduces to this 
Bayesian CCM when it is assumed that no nodes 
between the two parallel trees are ever aligned 
and when word-level alignments are ignored. We 
also reimplemented the original EM version of 
CCM and found virtually no difference in perfor-
mance when using EM or Gibbs sampling. In both 
cases our implementation achieves F-measure in 
the range of 69-70% on WSJ10, broadly in line 
with the performance reported by Klein and Man-
ning (2002).

yields and contexts and 8 for distituent yields and 
contexts. In our Bayesian model, these similar 
smoothing counts occur as the parameters of the 
Dirichlet priors. For Korean we found that the 
baseline performed well using these values. How-
ever, on our English and Chinese data, we found 
that somewhat higher smoothing values worked 
best, so we utilized values of 20 and 80 for con-
stituent and distituent smoothing counts, respec-
tively.
# Para 576 20
Our model additionally requires hyperparam-
eter values for w (the coupling distribution for 
aligned yields), Gzpair and Gznode (the distribu-
tions over Giza-scores for aligned nodes and un-
aligned nodes, respectively). For w we used a 
symmetric Dirichlet prior with parameter 1. For 
Gzpair and Gznode, in order to create a strong bias 
towards high Giza-scores, we used non-symmetric 
Dirichlet priors. In both cases, we capped the ab-
solute value of the scores at 3, to prevent count 
sparsity. In the case of Gzpair we gave pseudo- 
counts of 1,000 for negative values and zero, and 
pseudo-counts of 1,000,000 for positive scores. 
For Gznode we gave a pseudo-count of 1,000,000 
for a score of zero, and 1,000 for all nega-
tive scores. This very strong prior bias encodes 
our intuition that syntactic alignments which re-
spect lexical alignments should be preferred. Our 
method is not sensitive to these exact values and 
any reasonably strong bias gave similar results.
# Para 596 2
In all our experiments, we consider the hyper- 
parameters fixed and observed values.
# Para 598 5
Testing and evaluation As mentioned above, 
we test our model only on monolingual data, 
where the parallel sentences are not provided to 
the model. To predict the bracketings of these 
monolingual test sentences, we take the smoothed
# Para 603 6
counts accumulated in the final round of sampling 
over the training data and perform a maximum 
likelihood estimate of the monolingual CCM pa-
rameters. These parameters are then used to pro-
duce the highest probability bracketing of the test 
set.
# Para 609 12
To evaluate both our model as well as the base-
line, we use (unlabeled) bracket precision, re-
call, and F-measure (Klein and Manning, 2002). 
Following previous work, we include the whole- 
sentence brackets but ignore single-word brack-
ets. We perform experiments on different subsets 
of training and testing data based on the sentence- 
length. In particular we experimented with sen-
tence length limits of 10, 20, and 30 for both the 
training and testing sets. We also report the upper 
bound on F-measure for binary trees. We average 
the results over 10 separate sampling runs.

5 Results
# Para 622 8
Table 1 reports the full results of our experiments. 
In all testing scenarios the bilingual model out-
performs its monolingual counterpart in terms of 
both precision and recall. On average, the bilin-
gual model gains 10.2 percentage points in preci-
sion, 7.7 in recall, and 8.8 in F-measure. The gap 
between monolingual performance and the binary 
tree upper bound is reduced by over 19%.
# Para 630 9
The extent of the gain varies across pairings. 
For instance, the smallest improvement is ob-
served for English when trained with Urdu. The 
Korean-English pairing results in substantial im-
provements for Korean and quite large improve-
ments for English, for which the absolute gain 
reaches 28 points in F-measure. In the case of Chi-
nese and English, the gains for English are fairly 
minimal whereas those for Chinese are quite sub-

stantial. This asymmetry should not be surprising, 
as Chinese on its own seems to be quite a bit more 
difficult to parse than English.
# Para 679 12
We also investigated the impact of sentence 
length for both the training and testing sets. For 
our model, adding sentences of greater length to 
the training set leads to increases in parse accu-
racy for short sentences. For the baseline, how-
ever, adding this additional training data degrades 
performance in the case of English paired with Ko-
rean. Figure 2 summarizes the performance of 
our model for different sentence lengths on sev-
eral of the test-sets. As shown in the figure, the 
largest improvements tend to occur at longer sen-
tence lengths.

6 Conclusion
# Para 692 9
We have presented a probabilistic model for bilin-
gual grammar induction which uses raw parallel 
text to learn tree pairs and their alignments. Our 
formalism loosely binds the two trees, using bilin-
gual patterns when possible, but allowing substan-
tial language-specific variation. We tested our 
model on three test sets and showed substantial 
improvement over a state-of-the-art monolingual 
baseline.4
