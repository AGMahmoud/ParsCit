ABSTRACT
# Para 7 9
Users are now performing more sophisticated web tasks. In 
this work, we explore web tasks that require multiple web 
sessions to complete (multi-session tasks) to satisfy a goal. 
We conducted a web-based diary study and a field study 
that used a customized version of Firefox which logged the 
participants’ interactions for multi-session tasks and all 
their web activity. We found that multi-session tasks occur 
frequently and that users utilize a variety of browser tools 
and actions to help complete these tasks.

INTRODUCTION
# Para 22 11
There has been a growth of information available on the 
Web and as result there has been an evolution of the type of 
tasks that people perform. For example, today many tasks 
can be performed using services available on the Web (e.g., 
booking a flight, or buying a new dress). Despite this 
growth in how the Web is being used, most tools provided 
by the popular browsers have not changed much. Browser 
tools tend to still focus on supporting tasks that can be 
completed in a single web browser session and there are 
few standard browser tools available to users to support 
tasks that require multiple web sessions to complete.
# Para 33 9
While research has been conducted on user behaviour for 
single web session tasks, for specific web tasks, and for 
monitoring web information, we are exploring non- 
monitoring tasks that take multiple web sessions to 
complete (multi-session tasks). A multi-session task is goal- 
based, requires more than one web session to complete and, 
has a definable point as to when the task is over, such as a 
specific date, an event that occurs (e.g., you finally 
purchase the computer), or that it is abandoned. It is not a

routine task (e.g., reading the news every day or checking 
your email on a regular basis).
# Para 52 21
In this research, we are interested in learning about the type 
of tasks that cross multiple web sessions, in finding out how 
users are performing these tasks (i.e., what browser tools 
they are using) and in determining what problems they 
encounter while performing these tasks. We anticipate that 
users will have some difficulties performing multi-session 
tasks while also doing other web activities in a single 
session (i.e., multi-tasking) and in resuming their task when 
they return to it at a later time. We expect that most multi- 
session tasks are expected, that is that when the user begins 
the task they know that it will continue over several 
sessions. We also expect that there will be occasions when 
a user begins a task that they assume will take a single 
session to complete but it unexpectedly turns into a multi- 
session task (i.e., there is not enough time to finish or the 
task is more complex than originally thought). We also 
anticipate that when users are performing these tasks, they 
use particular browser tools and possibly other applications 
to help organize the information that they find (such as print 
web pages), and that users may use other applications to 
interpret information (such as a calculator).
# Para 73 7
We use the results of a diary study and field study to 
determine how to better support users performing multi- 
session tasks. The contribution of this research includes a 
characterization of how users perform multi-session tasks, a 
characterization of these tasks, and it provides 
recommendations for browser tool features to help support 
multi-session tasks.

RELATED WORK
# Para 81 1
Web Tasks
# Para 82 13
There has been a lot of research conducted on user 
behaviour on the Web to try to understand and/or categorize 
the different types of web tasks in which people perform [1, 
4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 12, 17]. For example, Choo et al. [6] outlined 
four task categories for the Web, and Sellen et al. [15] 
found six web task categories based on observation. Kellar, 
et al. [12], classified web tasks, similar to Sellen et al. [15] 
as fact finding (e.g., looking for specific information), 
information gathering (e.g., researching a paper), browsing 
(e.g., entertainment or passing time), transactions (e.g., 
online banking), communications (e.g., emailing), and 
maintenance (e.g., updating a web page). Kellar et al. [1 1] 
also explored web monitoring and found that monitoring of

# Para 97 3
information exists across all task types and involves 
revisiting web pages to view new or updated information 
(e.g., reading the news or checking Facebook).
# Para 100 1
Revisitation Web Activity
# Para 101 15
Some web tasks can be completed within a single session. 
Other web tasks need multiple sessions and may require a 
users to return to an already seen page or pages to continue 
with the task, complete the task or repeat the task (e.g., to 
monitor a page). Tauscher and Greenberg [17] found that 
58% of pages visited by users had been previously 
accessed. Cockburn and MacKenzie [8] and Cockburn et al. 
[7] reported that 81% of visits to web pages are to pages 
that have been previously seen. Sellen et al. [15] found that 
many information gathering tasks (40%) took more than 
one session to complete and Kellar et al. [12] reported that 
59% of information gathering tasks were repeated. Brown 
and Sellen [3] also found that many users’ information 
needs spanned across several web pages which may be 
accessed in more than one session.
# Para 116 1
Current Web Browser Revisitation Tools
# Para 117 8
Despite the explosive growth of the Web and an increase in 
the number and type of web users the current browsers and 
the tools have changed little. For example, the web browser 
Mosaic (http://www.ncsa.uiuc.edu/Projects/mosaic.html) 
that was available with support from 1993 to 1997 had tools 
that were very similar to the tools found in most freeware 
browsers today (e.g., history list, hotlist, hotlist manager, 
home page, and forward/back buttons).
# Para 125 6
Some browser tools are designed to aid people to revisit 
web pages during a single session (i.e., to find pages in the 
current session) and others help users revisit pages over 
multiple sessions (i.e., to return to pages at a later date) [9]. 
The two most common browser tools for revisiting pages 
over multiple sessions are history lists and bookmarks.
# Para 131 13
History lists keep a record of all previously seen pages for a 
set period of time. Many studies have shown [2, 5, 7, 8, 12, 
17] that users tend not to use history lists as problems exist 
such as, duplicate entries and inconsistent page names [7, 
8]. Bookmarks (or Favorites) provide access to previously 
visited web pages. While bookmarks provide advantages as 
they can be grouped by categories and act as placeholders 
[1], there are disadvantages such as the need for managing 
these links [1] or refinding pages can be quite difficult. 
Despite these shortcomings people still use bookmarks [1, 
2, 3, 4, 11, 12, 17], and other strategies [2, 3, 4, 15] 
including using search engines to relocate pages, printing or 
saving web pages, or emailing links to themselves or others.
# Para 144 7
There has been recent research into developing new tools to 
help users revisit and organize their information for use 
over several sessions, such as Session Highlights [2, 9] and 
Webscrapbooks [15]. Other tools stand alone or combine 
existing tools into one providing single or multi-session 
support (or both). For example, Kaasten and Greenberg 
[10] integrated the back key, history list and bookmarks
# Para 151 6
into a single tool and provided a visual representation of 
how often pages were visited. Landmarks [14] can be used 
to enhance the revisitation of a web page with the refinding 
of information on the page by automatically scrolling to the 
exact location of user marked text when the page is 
reopened.
# Para 157 1
METHODOLOGY
# Para 158 15
We designed a mixed methodology to better validate the 
results using two approaches: a diary study and a field 
study. A diary study has the advantage of allowing us to 
collect information in an unobtrusive manner as participants 
self report their behaviour to identify and discover patterns 
of user behaviour [16]. We performed interviews at the end 
of the diary study to help verify the diary entries [16]. In 
the diary study [13], participants self-reported their multi- 
session tasks using a web-based diary. In particular, we 
were interested in finding out how often participants engage 
in multi-session tasks, how often participants return to work 
on the task during the study period, the types of tasks that 
participants classify as multi-session, which browser 
functions or tools participants use for these tasks and the 
frequency of use of these tools.
# Para 173 11
We used the data in the diary study to help us better define 
multi-session tasks and to help in the design of the logging 
feature for the customized version of Firefox for the field 
study. For both studies, we tried to minimize the effort of 
the participants by providing tools to make the recording of 
tasks easier (a web-based diary for the diary study and a 
customized toolbar in Firefox for the field study). While 
we acknowledged that having participants explicitly record 
their multi-session tasks may influence their behaviour, we 
felt that this was a necessary trade off to gather the relevant 
data relating specifically to multi-session tasks.
# Para 184 6
We use the qualitative and quantitative data collected 
during the diary study, the field study and the interviews to 
determine how the participants are performing multi- 
session tasks. We also consider a set of relevant findings 
for developers and researchers to use when designing 
browser tool features to help support multi-session tasks.
# Para 190 1
The Diary Study
# Para 191 14
Twenty-two participants (12 male and 10 female) from a 
university community of students, faculty and staff took 
part in the web-based diary study. Half the participants 
used Internet Explorer (IE) as their main browser and half 
used Firefox. Participants ranged in age from 19 years old 
to 50 years old, with the average age being 28 years. There 
were 16 students (11 graduate and 5 undergraduates), and 
six university employees (1 being a faculty member). The 
majority of the students (11/16) were in computer science. 
Seventy-seven percent (17/22) of the participants indicated 
that they use the Web several times a day and about 64% 
(14/22) of participants reported that they spend at least 11 
hours a week using the Web. Participants were 
compensated $25 for each week they took part in the study.

Figure 1: A Sample List of active Multi-session Tasks
# Para 208 14
Participants recorded their multi-session tasks using a web- 
based diary over the study period (18 participants for a one 
week study period, and four participants for a two week 
study period). We met with participants at the beginning to 
describe the study. We explained multi-session tasks (both 
expected and not expected) and demonstrated the web 
diary. Recorded multi-session tasks could be both expected 
and unexpected. For this study, participants were asked to 
record, as a session, each time they visited the Web to work 
on the task. Participants were asked to use their web diary 
each time they began and returned to a multi-session task. 
The tasks could have begun previously to the study and 
could continue after the study. At the end of the study, 
participants took part in a semi-structured interview.
# Para 222 6
We provided a password protected web-based worksheet to 
minimize the effort of the participants to record task 
information. The diary worksheet contained radio buttons, 
checks, comment boxes, and drop-down lists for easy input. 
When users added a new task, the task was added to their 
active task list for later selection (Figure 1).
# Para 228 13
Participants were encouraged to keep the diary open in a 
separate browser window or tab when they used the Web 
and to fill in the diary as the task occurred (although they 
could enter the information at a later time). The diary 
recorded: the task name, task description, if the task was 
expected or not, estimated finish date or time when the task 
would end, reason to stop working on the task, where the 
task was performed, what was worked on during the 
session, the browser tools they used during the session and 
finally if the overall task was complete. The name, 
description, expected finish date and whether it was 
expected or unexpected were only recorded once during the 
initial session of the task.
# Para 241 9
At the end of the study, participants took part in a semi- 
structured interview. Participants were asked to go through 
one of their multi-session tasks in detail and were asked 
questions regarding the concept of multi-session tasks in 
general (e.g., “Are the tools you use for multi-session tasks 
different than other tasks?”). We demonstrated up to four 
tools to get the participants’ feedback as to their 
appropriateness for multi-session tasks: tabs to the IE users, 
session saver, Landmarks [14], and an annotation tool.
# Para 250 4
Based on the participants’ diary entries and comments 
during the interviews, we were able to further refine our 
definition of multi-session tasks. We expanded our original 
definition of multi-session to be a task that is goal based,
# Para 254 3
that often requires sub-tasks to complete, and that has a 
temporal element (i.e., the task has a deadline or is finished 
once the goal is achieved).
# Para 257 1
Field Study
# Para 258 17
We then ran a four week field study where participants used 
a customized version of Firefox for all of their web 
browsing sessions. This customized version logged all of 
their interactions in the browser. Twenty-four university 
students (20 male and 4 female) were recruited to 
participate. We recruited participants who used the Web 
daily, and who used Firefox as their main web browser. 
There were 14 computer science students, 6 commerce 
students, and 4 were from health profession studies 
(kinesiology, occupational therapy, health informatics, 
health and human performance). Six of the 24 participants 
were graduate students. The age of participants ranged 
from 18 to 35 years old with an average age of 24. A large 
majority of participants (21/24) indicated that they use the 
Web several times a day, and 58% (14/24) checked that 
they used the Web at least 11 hours a week. Participants 
were compensated $50 for finishing the study.
# Para 275 7
We met with participants at the beginning of the study to 
explain the details of the study, to demonstrate and install 
our browser and to define multi-session tasks. We used the 
modified definition from the diary study. For this study, a 
session was logged each time they opened and closed the 
browser. Consequently, we captured both the times of all 
activities and periods of inactivity.
# Para 282 4
Over the study period, participants used our browser for all 
their web use. The browser not only logged all of the 
participants’ interactions with the browser but also had an 
additional toolbar Figure 2 (a) that was used by participants
# Para 286 1
only when they worked on multi-session tasks. Participants
# Para 287 4
were asked to submit daily web logs using a submit button 
built into the toolbar. If there were any problems with 
submitting the log electronically, the log was stored on their 
hard drive, although no problems occurred during the study.
# Para 291 8
Our customized version of Firefox captured all user 
interactions in a log format as shown in Table 1. All logged 
data was stored on a secure server only accessible by the 
researchers. Each participant accessed the browser with a 
unique username/password to ensure that the logs only 
contained the study participants’ data. The log contained 
the following information: Computer, Event Id, Window Id, 
Tab Id, Date, Time, Name, URL and Session Description.
# Para 299 9
Participants could install the browser on multiple computers 
thereby providing access to their multi-session tasks from 
any location. Computer was a self chosen name by the 
participant representing the computer that the browser was 
installed on. Each action that the participant did on the 
browser was given a unique Event Id number. When a new 
window or tab was opened during a session they were 
numbered (Window Id and Tab Id respectively) starting at 
0. The Date and Time were recorded for each action. The

name was the actual action that the participant performed 
(e.g., opened bookmark or followed link) and, when 
appropriate, how the action was performed (e.g., from the 
menu, using control keys, from the toolbar, etc.). The URL 
is the web page address for any pages visited on a browser 
action. Session Description recorded additional 
information on the multi-session tasks (e.g., when they 
were started, resumed and stopped).
# Para 343 14
In addition to capturing the user interactions, participants 
indicated when they started and continued to work on a 
multi-session task by using the interactive toolbar. To start 
a new task, participants pressed the “Start New Transient 
Task” button (note, for this study, we used our earlier label 
‘transient task’ to refer to multi-session task). Participants 
then filled in a web form shown in Figure 2 (b) that 
described the multi-session task (task title, task description, 
whether it was expected or not and estimated completion 
date). Once they selected the “Start” button on the web 
form, the name of the task would appear on the toolbar 
highlighted in yellow (Figure 2 (c)). Participants also 
indicated when a window or tab was included in the task 
with the “include/exclude” toggle buttons on the toolbar.
# Para 357 4
When the participants stopped the task (“Stop Task” 
button), another web form appeared in which the 
participants recorded information on the task they just 
worked on (what sub-task they worked on, whether they
# Para 361 5
finished the sub-task, why they stopped for that session, 
other applications used and if the task was finished). To 
resume a task later, the participant could select a task name 
from a drop-down list of active tasks that appeared when 
they selected the “Resume Task” button.
# Para 366 5
Participants also used the toolbar to submit their web logs. 
To submit their daily logs, they pressed the “Submit Log” 
button on the toolbar. Participants could view their logs 
(“View Log”) and could delete any URLs they did not want 
the researchers to see with the “Manage Log URLs” button.
# Para 371 9
At the end of the study, we met again with participants for a 
semi-structured interview that was formatted similarly to 
the interview given after the diary study, to discuss one of 
their multi-session tasks in more detail and multi-session 
tasks in general. This interview also gave us the opportunity 
to demonstrate and receive feedback for possible types of 
tools that may be useful for multi-session tasks. We 
demonstrated the same tools as in the diary study (with the 
exception of tabs) and also included ‘Google Notebook’.
# Para 380 1
Limitations of the Studies
# Para 381 5
While we did use a ‘convenient sample’, this provided us 
with an experienced set of web users. Our population and 
sample numbers are comparable to other studies [3, 6, 12, 
15] which also reported on experienced users (office 
workers or students) to acquire a deeper understanding of

how these users perform web tasks. Students tend to be 
early adaptors of technologies and are heavy users of the 
Web. We felt for an initial exploration into multi-session 
tasks, that this population would provide a robust picture 
with a mix of techniques and approaches to the task.
# Para 397 12
There are trade offs when designing studies. While web 
server logs can contain large amounts of quantitative data 
on a large population, the data does not include an 
understanding of the motivation of the user. Our studies 
were selected to record a rich data set consisting of self- 
motivated tasks collected within the participants’ own 
environment. Our results established that there are different 
types of multi-session tasks that often contain several sub- 
tasks. We also captured other interesting data points, such 
as reasons to stop and restart the tasks and task switching 
within each session. The interviews helped to refine how 
we can support experienced users perform these tasks.

We present the results according to User Behaviour and 
Task Characteristics. Where appropriate we report on the 
self-reported web diary entries, the field study automatic

presenting the results, we have included a sample of both a 
dairy and a field study log to show what multi-session task 
information was recorded and to also display how 
participants approached multi-session tasks.

June (after the study period). The participant recorded 
working on the task three times during the study, at 
different times during the day. For example, on May 19th at 
11:00 the participant submitted their web diary information. 
The participant worked on the task for 5-15 minutes each 
time to look for accommodations. The participant indicated 
that they opened windows, used their history list, typed a 
web address, used a search engine, searched within a page 
and emailed someone else during these sessions. It is 
interesting to note that on the last entry, it would seem as 
though a response to a previous email prompted the 
participant to return to the task.

“Physics A4” (see Table 3). This was an expected task, 
described as “4th Physics Assignment”. The task started on 
September 30th and finished on October 6th. The participant 
worked on the task five times. Table 3 contains 
information that the participant recorded each time they 
stopped working on the task (using the interactive toolbar). 
Using the logged data, we determined what actions they 
performed during each visit. For example, on September

30th the participant worked on the task for about an hour 
and a half and submitted a form 20 times, followed links 15 
times, copied into the browser two times, excluded a tab 
once and switched back into the task once (that is went 
from an excluded tab to an included tab). We can also 
anticipate from the gaps in time between the actions 
recorded in the browser (at most, 10 minutes) that the 
participant, while working on the task, was also either 
reading material on the Web related to the task (as there 
was only one occurrence of switching from the task), 
working on the assignment (e.g., they recorded also using a 
calculator while working on the task), or perhaps doing 
something unrelated to the task (e.g., taking a short break).
# Para 503 1
User Behaviour
# Para 504 8
We explored the behaviour of participants with respect to 
multi-session tasks. We examined how many multi-session 
tasks participants recorded, the number of web sessions in 
which participants performed multi-session tasks and how 
often participants executed multi-session tasks while 
working on other web tasks We also examined the actual 
browser tools and actions that participants used to perform 
multi-session tasks.

during the first week). Ten of these tasks were recorded as 
unexpected. The average number of multi-session tasks for 
each participant was 3.86 tasks. The tasks (85) were worked 
on over a total of 204 sessions (the number of web sessions 
that participants worked on multi-session tasks). 
Participants worked on each task on average over 2.4 
sessions.
# Para 532 1
Field Study
# Para 533 4
Over the field study, 150 multi-session tasks were recorded 
(see Table 4), with 16 reported as unexpected. The average 
number of tasks per participant was 6.25. Participants 
worked on each task over an average of 2.61 sessions.
# Para 537 7
Since the field study was run over a four week period, it 
makes sense that there would be more tasks recorded and 
that number of tasks per participant was larger. It is 
interesting that the average number of sessions per task did 
not increase much, indicating that multi-session tasks for 
both studies are similar in the number of times the 
participants worked on a multi-session task.
# Para 544 11
In the diary study, we were only able to count how often a 
participant worked on their multi-session tasks. In the field 
study, however, we were also able to determine the total 
number of web sessions that took place over the study and 
what proportion of sessions contained multi-session tasks. 
There were a total of 1183 web sessions (which for this 
study, was each time the browser was opened and closed), 
of which 391 sessions contained multi-session tasks. There 
were 226 sessions in which participants worked solely on 
multi-session tasks, although occasionally they worked on 
more than one multi-session task during these sessions.
# Para 555 16
We were also able to determine when participants switched 
between a multi-session task and other web activities from 
the log that captured the toggling of the include/exclude 
radio buttons on the toolbar (see Figure 2 (c)). All 24 
participants switched from their multi-session tasks during 
the study. When a participant was working on a multi- 
session task they could include or exclude a web page in a 
tab or window from that task (see Table 1 for an example in 
the log of including a tab into the task). For example, when 
the participant had a web page open that was not being used 
for the current multi-session task they would exclude that 
tab. By default, the tab or window that a multi-session task 
was started or continued from was included in the current 
task along with any tabs or windows opened from an 
included tab/window. We logged four different actions that 
indicated a switch between tasks (see Table 5).

# Para 578 1
Table 5. Switching between Tasks
# Para 579 7
The action “Included this tab...” and “Excluded this tab...” 
was logged every time a participant used the include/ 
exclude button on the toolbar. The “Switched into task” 
and “Switched away from task” was logged every time a 
participant switched to a previously defined tab/window 
(included or excluded). In total, 627 task switching actions 
were recorded.
# Para 586 1
Browser Tools and Actions
# Para 587 4
The results presented below are based on diary entries (in 
terms of counts as recorded by participants), field study 
logs (actual counts as recorded by the browser logger) and 
post-study interviews (for specific revisitation tools).
# Para 591 1
Diary Study
# Para 592 14
For the diary study, participants were asked to record which 
browser tools or actions that they used while working on 
their multi-session tasks. While we can not track how often 
the tools or actions were used within each session, it does 
indicate what tools/actions were used for the multi-session 
tasks. This was useful in deciding what tools and actions we 
needed to track during the field study, and it did give us an 
indication as to the most common tools and actions used for 
their multi-session tasks. Overall there were 35 different 
tools or actions recorded by participants. Table 6 shows the 
top twelve tools and actions. Opening a window was the 
most often reported action during a multi-session task, as 
recorded 62 times by a variety of participants, followed by 
using a search engine and typing in a web page address.
# Para 606 8
In the post study interviews, we questioned participants on 
their use of bookmarks or other tools that they may have 
used to revisit information while working on multi-session 
tasks. Similar to other studies [1, 2, 3, 4, 15], the use of 
bookmarks and reasons for not using them varied among 
the participants. Half of the participants had used 
bookmarks for the task which was examined in the 
interview. Firefox users (whether they frequently used

bookmarks or not) used Firefox’s toolbar bookmarks for 
sites they revisit regularly but not, interestingly, for the 
multi-session tasks we were interested in (as they did not 
want to clutter their toolbar with sites that were considered 
temporary). Participants who did not use bookmarks 
tended to revisit pages by retyping URLs (often with auto 
complete) and re-searching terms. Participants also used 
other applications to help with their tasks. For example, 
several participants cut and pasted information into Word or 
Notepad to compare details and in order to store only 
relevant information.
# Para 635 1
Field Study
# Para 636 9
During the field study, 102 different browser tools and 
actions were captured (as recorded in Name in the logs, as 
seen in Table 1) which also included the way the action or 
tool was used (e.g., if a new tab was opened from the menu, 
control keys or buttons). In Table 7, we present the most 
common actions and tools as recorded in the field study 
logs. We also organized the use of tools and the actions 
used by multi-session tasks and by all other web activity. 
We present the counts and the percentage of the actions.
# Para 645 19
While the tools and actions recorded for other web 
activities tended to be higher than for multi-session tasks, 
there were fewer multi-session tasks in relation to the other 
logged web activities. Following a link was the most 
common activity logged. This count included links 
followed in the current page, links opened in a new 
window, and links opened in a new tab. Submitting a form 
commonly indicated when a participant was performing a 
search. The two most common forms submitted were to 
Google and to Google Scholar (93.55% for multi-session 
tasks) (both of which were used more often for multi- 
session tasks). Participants recorded using a number of 
different web search bars (e.g., IMDb and Wikipedia) but 
the most common was Google. Participants used cut/copy 
and paste into outside documents and into the browser itself 
in both single and multi-session tasks. Participants used the 
search within a page more often for multi-session tasks 
(53.27% vs. 46.73%) but typed in URLs less frequently for 
multi-session tasks (28.91% vs. 71.09%).
# Para 664 15
Using post-study interviews and the logs, we found similar 
results to the diary study with regard to participants using 
bookmarks. Only half of the participants said that they use 
bookmarks, and many of these participants indicated that 
they did not use bookmarks for multi-session tasks as they 
considered them too temporary and for some they did not 
want to clutter their bookmark list with transitory pages. 
Almost all of those who said that they use Firefox’s toolbar 
bookmarks reserved these for those pages that were 
frequently accessed. In the browser logs, the most common 
way that the participants opened their bookmarks was from 
the toolbar (987 of the 1441 incidences). We found support 
for the interview comments as only 15% of opening toolbar 
bookmarks were logged during multi-session tasks. Similar 
to the diary study interview comments, participants who did

# Para 704 1
Task Characteristics
# Para 705 10
For Task Classification we used the information that the 
participants self-reported on their multi-session tasks. As 
such we were to compare and report results from both the 
diary study and the field study. We found that participants 
from both studies reported comparable task characteristics. 
Using this information we were able to organize the multi- 
session tasks into eight types according to common themes. 
Furthermore, we found that the sub-tasks for the multi- 
session tasks could be classified using the web tasks 
categories as defined by Kellar et al. [12].
# Para 715 1
Task Types
# Para 716 10
Although the specific goals of the tasks recorded (235 tasks 
total from both studies) varied we were able to group the 
tasks using their task title and description into eight general 
types: school work (67), general topic search (66), research 
(25), travel/tourism (21), projects (19), action-based (18), 
shopping (14), and status checking (5). As Table 8 shows, 
the largest task type was school work (28.51%), which is 
not surprising as the majority of participants were students. 
There is a large difference between tasks classified as 
school work by the diary participants (7.06% of diary study

tasks) and the field study participants (40.67% of field 
study tasks) which we believe is due to the timing of each 
study; the diary study was run after a winter/spring term 
and the field study was run in the middle of a fall term.
# Para 748 20
We subdivided general topic search (28.09% of the tasks) 
into four sub-groups: looking for instructions or directions 
(e.g., how to use Skype or how to start a university society), 
looking up information, relocation (e.g., job hunting), and 
entertainment (e.g., reading up on world soccer). Research 
tasks (10.64% of the total tasks) had longer time lines and 
involved searching for a similar topic over several sessions. 
Travel/tourism tasks (8.94%) involved such actions as 
planning vacations and making conference arrangements. 
Project tasks (8.09%) lasted for longer periods and always 
contained sub-tasks. Action-based tasks (7.66%) involved 
transactions, such as completing online surveys and 
transferring money. Shopping (5.96%) included a variety of 
products, such as sandals and a laptop and involved actions 
such as price comparisons between web sites, bidding on 
eBay, emailing friends for feedback, and tracking 
shipments. For status checking (2.13%), participants 
continually checked on some information (e.g., watching 
for a cheque that was to be deposited to their bank account 
or checking for an updated course schedule).
# Para 768 1
Sub-task Types
# Para 769 9
When examining how participants worked on the task 
during each web session, we found there to be a series of 
sub-tasks within each task (for example, see Table 2 and 
Table 3 for sample study tasks and their sub-tasks). As 
Table 9 illustrates, there were a total of 428 sub-tasks 
recorded over both studies and interestingly, some of these 
sub-tasks also occurred over more than one session (e.g., 
booking flights was often done over several sessions in 
order to compare schedules and cost). The sub-tasks were

classified using the previously defined categories of web 
tasks of Kellar et al.[12]. We arranged these sub-tasks as 
follows: 228 as information gathering (53.27%), 119 as fact 
finding tasks (27.80%), 46 as transactions (10.75%), 21 as 
communication (4.91%), and 14 as maintenance (3.27%). 
We did not include browsing as it is considered a 
serendipitous act [11] usually performed for entertainment 
purposes. While some counts differed, we saw similar 
numbers for the different types of subtasks in the studies. 
One reason for the larger number of maintenance type 
subtasks in the diary study may be because there were 
university employees who were responsible for tasks 
involving the Web. In some cases, more than one type of 
sub-task occurred during a single session (e.g., during one 
session for the task “Attend Conference” in the diary study, 
the participant filled in the registration form and gathered 
accommodation details).
# Para 804 1
DISCUSSION
# Para 805 7
The main goal of the diary study and field study was to gain 
a better understanding of how participants perform multi- 
session tasks and to help characterize these tasks. A 
secondary goal of these studies was to provide data for 
researchers, including ourselves, to help in designing 
browser tools and/or in designing improvements for 
existing browser tools for multi-session tasks.
# Para 812 12
For both studies, we conducted post-study interviews where 
we demonstrated browser tools that we felt might be useful 
when working on multi-session tasks. This demonstration 
of the tools prompted participants into a discussion on the 
types of tools or features of tools that they thought would 
be helpful in performing multi-session tasks. We 
demonstrated tabs (to diary study participants who never 
used tabs), session saver (a Firefox extension that saves and 
reopens tabs), Landmarks [14], page annotations 
(www.mystickies.com) and Google Notebook (adds 
snippets of different web pages that can be shared) to the 
field study participants only.
# Para 824 7
Many of the suggestions for tools were repeated by the 
participants. The different suggestions for tools included 
improving bookmarks to include an automated system to 
create bookmark folders (e.g., based on search terms) and to 
remove bookmarks based on a user inputted expiry date. 
Other suggestions included having text editors in the 
browser, associating and organizing different types of

documents (e.g., emails, web pages, word files) together 
based on a topic, a reminder tool or task scheduler for the 
tasks that you are working on, combining session saver with 
Landmarks to indicate not only the pages that you last saw 
but where you were on the pages, keeping a history of web 
pages where you could go back to where you were in the 
page, having a project management system, and having 
access to a log of web pages that you can visit from any 
computer.
# Para 842 19
Using the comments from the post-study interviews, and 
the information collected during the diary study and field 
study, we have identified three main features for browser 
tools that may assist users perform their multi-session tasks. 
First, participants indicated that they would like a reminder 
feature, such as the one shown in Figure 2 (c) to keep them 
on task and to remind themselves of tasks in progress 
during the current session. Participants liked using the 
browser for multi-session tasks because seeing the task 
name in the toolbar helped to keep them on task. Second, 
we found that participants, especially with the addition of 
tabbed browsing, typically worked on several tasks during a 
single web session and that any new tool should support 
multi-tasking. Third, participants commented that they 
would like to be able to manage their tasks between 
sessions, including being able to quickly return to viewed 
pages in their last seen state, to be able to better organize 
information associated with the task, and to easily manage 
the removal of saved web pages at the end of the task.
# Para 861 1
CONCLUSIONS
# Para 862 4
Using the information that we collected during the diary 
study, the field study, and the interviews we have been able 
to identify how experienced web users perform multi- 
session tasks and classify multi-session tasks.
# Para 866 10
While asking participants to self-report their multi-session 
tasks may have added bias into the studies; we felt it was 
necessary in order to gain a greater understanding of how 
users perform these tasks. We asked the field study 
participants if the customized browser influenced their web 
behaviour and the majority responded that it did not. The 
others mainly noted (as mentioned before) that the toolbar 
helped keep them on task. A few participants noted some 
technical difficulties that they experienced as well (such as 
the bookmark manager not working properly).
# Para 876 6
In the future, we will analyze the logged data from the field 
study to examine more closely how users switched between 
multi-session tasks and other web activities and to explore a 
better definition of session using the time data. We also 
plan to develop prototype tools based on our above findings 
and evaluate these in a field study.
