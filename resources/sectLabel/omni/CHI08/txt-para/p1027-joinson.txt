ABSTRACT
# Para 11 12
This paper investigates the uses of social networking site 
Facebook, and the gratifications users derive from those 
uses. In the first study, 137 users generated words or 
phrases to describe how they used Facebook, and what they 
enjoyed about their use. These phrases were coded into 46 
items which were completed by 241 Facebook users in 
Study 2. Factor analysis identified seven unique uses and 
gratifications: social connection, shared identities, content, 
social investigation, social network surfing and status 
updating. User demographics, site visit patterns and the use 
of privacy settings were associated with different uses and 
gratifications.

INTRODUCTION
# Para 29 10
Social networking sites such as MySpace, LinkedIn and 
Facebook have become hugely popular in the last few 
years. In July 2007, social networking sites occupied five of 
the top fifteen visited websites according to Alexa.com. On 
July 10, 2007, Facebook.com reported signing up its 30 
millionth user, with a year on year increase in unique users 
of 89% [12]. In the UK, use of Facebook increased by 
500% between November 2006 and May 2007 [19]. 
MySpace is reported (although disputed [10]) to have over 
100 million users [4].

# Para 47 8
Social networking sites typically provide users with a 
profile space, facilities for uploading content (e.g. photos, 
music), messaging in various forms and the ability to make 
connections to other people. These connections (or 
‘friends’) are the core functionality of a social network site 
[5, 6] although most also provide opportunities for 
communication, the forming of groups, hosting of content 
and small applications.
# Para 55 5
Given the growth of social networking sites, it is perhaps 
unsurprising that their use has garnered media attention, 
including the seemingly now obligatory scare stories 
involving predatory child sex offenders [20], identity theft 
[1], workplace usage levels [9] and even addiction [8].
# Para 60 12
In many recent cases, this coverage has focused on 
Facebook.com, which was originally restricted to users with 
an ‘.edu’ e-mail address. In September 2006, Facebook 
opened registration to non-college based users. This change 
led to rapid growth in the number of users, as well as 
almost viral growth within non-educational organizations. 
For instance, the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) 
network (which requires a BBC email address) has circa 
10,000 members, approximately 50% of employees [21]. 
Since May 2007, Facebook has also allowed the 
development and implementation of third-party applications 
(see dev.facebook.com).
# Para 72 9
Before opening to non-academic (and non-US-based) users, 
Facebook.com was peculiar amongst social networking 
sites since many of the social networks its users built were 
based on offline, geographically confined groups (e.g. a 
campus). Termed ‘networks’ by the site (which have 
recently expanded to include non-university based 
geographic areas and workplaces), this reflection of the 
offline community in the online environment may have led 
to unique forms of use amongst users [17].
# Para 81 1
User motivation and social networking sites
# Para 82 4
Social networks serve a number of functions in offline life – 
for instance, providing social and emotional support, 
information resources and ties to other people [25]. Similar 
kinds of social networks have been identified in online
# Para 86 1
1027
# Para 87 1
CHI 2008 Proceedings · Online Social Networks	April 5-10, 2008 · Florence, Italy
# Para 88 4
communities [7, 25], with users turning online for both 
emotional support and as an information resource (e.g. via a 
mailing list). In both cases, an online social network may 
provide users with social capital [7].
# Para 92 30
Online social networking sites may also serve a number of 
other purposes [5, 16]. Lampe et al. [16] draw a distinction 
between the use of Facebook for ‘social searching’ – 
finding out information about offline contacts, and ‘social 
browsing’ – the use of the site to develop new connections, 
sometimes with the aim of offline interaction. A survey of 
over 2,000 students, found evidence that the primary use of 
Facebook was for ‘social searching’ – that is, using 
Facebook to find out more about people who they have met 
offline, or who they attend class or share a dormitory with 
[16]. The use of Facebook for ‘social browsing’, for 
instance, to meet someone via the site with the intention of 
a later offline meeting, or to attend an event organized 
online, scored relatively low amongst their sample. The 
main use reported by the sample studied by Lampe et al. 
[16, see also 7] was to, “keep in touch with an old friend or 
someone I knew from high school”, an activity that while 
expressing the offline aspects of social searching, also 
suggests a social capital function for Facebook. Golder et 
al. [11] report that while the vast majority of messages are 
sent to friends (90.6%), a large proportion (41.6%) is sent 
to friends outside of one’s local network. This suggests that 
messaging is used to maintain and build social ties across 
distances. In comparison, ‘pokes’ (a form of content-free 
messaging) were primarily exchanged within a network / 
school (98.3% of all pokes were within a network). Golder 
et al. [11] argue that friendship ties require little effort or 
investment to maintain, while messaging with 
geographically distant friends is used to build social capital 
[7].
# Para 122 14
According to Lampe et al. [16], social networking sites like 
Facebook may also serve a surveillance function, allowing 
users to “track the actions, beliefs and interests of the larger 
groups to which they belong” (p. 167). The surveillance and 
‘social search’ functions of Facebook may, in part, explain 
why so many Facebook users leave their privacy settings 
relatively open [13]. If ‘social searching’ is a public good, 
then reciprocity rules would dictate that by enabling a 
degree of surveillance of oneself, one would should also be 
able to engage in reciprocal surveillance of others. For 
instance, Gross and Acquisti [13] report that only 1.2% of 
users changed the default ‘search’ privacy setting, and less 
than 1/2% of users changed the default ‘profile visibility’ 
privacy settings.
# Para 136 8
Enabling Facebook users who are not currently linked as 
friends to view personal aspects of one’s profile may also 
be a strategy to increase the size of one’s social network. In 
support of this view, [17] report that users completion of 
profile fields that share a common referent (e.g. class, 
hometown) is positively associated with more friends, 
perhaps because such information encourages the 
development of ties based on shared experiences. Profile
# Para 144 2
elements that focused on individual likes and dislikes did 
not have an association with the number of friends.
# Para 146 13
As noted earlier, Facebook.com has undergone radical 
change over the last twelve months. By moving outside of 
the US-academic environment and embracing users 
globally and outside of academia, it has not only changed 
the profile of its users, but also the potential motivations for 
their use. While tightly controlled, geographically bounded 
networks based on university affiliation still exist, they are 
dwarfed by networks based outside of academia – for 
instance, as of September 2007, the ‘London’ network has 
over 1 million members, New York over 355,000 and 
Toronto over 800,000. The present paper examines the 
motivations of Facebook users using a ‘uses and 
gratifications’ framework.
# Para 159 15
Uses and gratifications refer to the ‘how and why’ of media 
use [23]. Specifically, ‘uses and gratifications’ refer to the 
motivations of specific uses, and the satisfaction people 
gain from such use. These gratifications can be divided into 
those based on the content of the media (content 
gratifications) and those based on the actual experience of 
using the media (process gratifications). Typically, content 
gratifications are held to be related to the repeated use of a 
media [18] which for the designers of such systems relates 
to a site’s ‘stickiness’. However, the Internet, and social 
networking sites in particular, also provide communication 
and interaction, unlike many ‘old media’ (e.g. television). 
This led Stafford et al. [23] to propose a third form of 
gratification arising from Internet use: as a social 
environment.
# Para 174 7
In the present study, the usual two stage approach to 
studying uses and gratification is adopted [3]. In Study 1, 
Facebook users are asked to generate lists of words or 
phrases that describe their uses and gratifications in an 
exploratory way. In Study 2, these terms are subjected to 
factor analysis in order to form grouped profiles of specific 
uses and gratifications.

# Para 183 9
Participants were 137 Facebook users who responded to a 
request to complete a short online study. The sample 
comprised 53 males and 88 females (Mean age = 26.3 
years). Participants were recruited through a number of 
different methods: postings to the ‘wall’ of three network 
homepages on Facebook (two universities, one regional), a 
paid flyer shown 10,000 times across all networks, and 
links on academic survey websites. The survey was open 
during the first two weeks of July 2007.
# Para 192 1
Materials
# Para 193 4
The online survey comprised a series of basic demographic 
questions (e.g. age, gender, occupation, location), alongside 
some measures of use of Facebook (time spent on site each 
week, number of friends linked on site, history of use).

Two raters clustered the descriptive items and phrases 
developed by Facebook users in response to the first 
question. The raters worked collaboratively to develop the 
clusters, and were instructed to ‘identify responses that are 
related’. The author then discussed the themes with the 
raters, and named them accordingly. The main themes 
identified are outlined in Table 1.

In keeping with previous research [e.g. 16], the use of 
Facebook to ‘keep in touch’ received the largest number of

receiving a small number of mentions.

Item generation
# Para 244 8
A sample of items from each use and gratification proposed 
by users was extracted from the exploratory list developed 
in Study 1. Participants’ responses to items 2–4 were 
examined, and any occurrences of other uses or 
gratifications not mentioned in response to the first item 
were added to the list. This led to a total of 46 items. Where 
possible, the item was taken word for word from participant 
responses to Study 1.
# Para 252 1
Participants
# Para 253 11
Participants were 241 Facebook users recruited using the 
same methods outlined in Study 1. In addition, e-mails were 
sent to selected mailing lists with a request for participation 
(e.g. AIR-L). Participants were 80 males (33.2%) and 161 
(66.8%) females (mean age = 25.97 years (SD = 9.30, range 
15-66 years old). The majority of the sample were full time 
students (n = 151, 62.7%), 6.6% (n = 16) were part-time 
students and worked part- or full-time (or had carer 
responsibilities), and 30.7% were in full-time work and not 
studying (n = 78). The study was open during the final 
week in July, and throughout August.
# Para 264 1
Measures
# Para 265 6
The same demographic and Facebook use measures 
described in Study 1 were used in Study 2. Participants also 
completed an item related to their use of Facebook privacy 
settings, specifically if they had changed the default 
settings, and if so, the degree to which they had made them 
more private or more open.
# Para 271 5
Participants were finally asked to rate, using a 7-point 
Likert scale, the 46 uses and gratifications derived from 
Study 1 using the metric, “How important are the following 
uses of Facebook to you personally?’ The scale was 
anchored at 1 (very unimportant) and 7 (very important).
# Para 276 1
Results
# Para 277 13
Participants had an average of 124 friends linked to their 
Facebook profile (Range 1-1000, Median = 85, SD = 
129.97). Around half of the participants had been registered 
on the site for less than six months (6.3% for less than one 
month, 9.6% for between one and two months and 29.2% 
for between two and six months). The remaining 
participants had been signed up for between six months and 
a year (21.7%), more than one year, but less than two 
(21.7%) or for more than two years (10.8%). The majority 
of participants visited the site either daily (38.8%) or more 
than once a day (27.5%). Almost a quarter visited Facebook 
several times a week (22.5%), with 6.7% visiting once a 
week on average, and 4.2% visiting less than once a week.

# Para 292 7
Amongst all respondents, the most common responses for 
the time spent on the site each week were between 1 and 2 
hours (33.3%) and between 2 and 5 hours (32.5%). A 
relatively small proportion of users claimed to spend either 
less than 1 hour a week (16.9%) or between 5 and 10 hours 
(11.0%) on the site. The proportion of users claiming more 
than 10 hours Facebook use per week was small (5.4%).
# Para 299 11
Unlike previous research [13], the majority of users claimed 
to have changed the default privacy settings in Facebook, 
with 25.6% (n = 61) reporting making their profile 
‘somewhat’ more private, 21% (n = 50) ‘much more’ 
private and 10.9% (n = 26) making it ‘as private as 
possible. A smaller group claimed to have made their 
profile either more ‘open’ (9.2%, n = 22) or ‘as open to 
others as possible (9.2%, n = 22). The number of people 
making no changes to their profile (23.5%, n = 56) was 
substantially lower than that reported in previous studies 
[ 14].
# Para 310 6
The most important uses of Facebook tended to be related 
to the ‘social searching’ and surveillance functions (see 
Tables 2-8), identified by [16]. Specifically, the use of the 
site to learn about old friends and maintain or re-connect 
relations scored consistently highly. This pattern repeats 
previous findings from student samples [7, 16].
# Para 316 11
To investigate the nature of the various uses and 
gratifications of Facebook in more depth, exploratory factor 
analysis was conducted. The initial factor analysis (varimax 
rotation) yielded 9 components with eigenvalues over 1, 
explaining 64.8% of the variance. Examination of the scree 
plot and unique loadings suggested that seven components 
(explaining 59% of the variance) should be retained for 
further analysis. Only four items did not load on any of the 
factors: one was related to privacy settings, two about use 
of the ‘poke’ facility and one about leaving messages on the 
‘wall’.
# Para 327 2
INTERPRETATION OF FACTORS AND SCALE 
DEVELOPMENT
# Para 329 9
To aid further analysis, scales were developed from each 
factor. As a preliminary check, score distributions on each 
item were examined to ensure that none suffered from 
restricted range (i.e., the full range of response options was 
being used). This was the case for all items. Items were 
identified as markers of each factor based on the commonly 
used benchmark of a loading greater than .5. Items that had 
significant loadings on other factors were discounted as 
marker items [22].
# Para 338 4
Application of these criteria led to identification of eight 
marker items for Factor 1, three for Factors 2, four for 
Factor 3, four each for Factor 4 and 5, and three each for 
Factor 6 and 7.
# Para 342 4
Factor 1 (Table 2) contains items predominantly concerned 
with ‘keeping in touch’ (the most often mentioned use of 
Facebook in Study 1, and by [16]). The items have a clear 
focus on re-connecting with lost contacts and maintaining
# Para 346 12
contact with existing friends. Some of the items loading on 
this factor also clearly relate to the ‘surveillance’ function 
identified by [16], for instance, ‘Finding out what old 
friends are doing now”. Others are more closely related to 
the creation or maintenance of ‘weak ties’ (e.g. 
“Maintaining relationships with people you may not get to 
see very often”). Because of the combination of 
surveillance and social capital functions, this factor and 
related scale is labeled ‘social connection’. Two items 
loaded on this factor, but did not meet the criteria for factor 
purity: ‘Reading messages on your wall’ and ‘Seeing how 
old acquaintances look’).
# Para 358 8

Table 2: Items and loading (Factor 1)
# Para 367 12
The second factor is comprised of three items related to the 
joining of groups, organization of events and meeting of 
‘like-minded people’ (see Table 3). These activities are akin 
to ‘social browsing’ identified by Lampe et al.; although 
there is no reason to assume that they are necessarily 
motivated by a desire to meet offline eventually. It also 
contains related to the discovery of new music and new 
groups via friends. As such, it seems to represent a ‘shared 
identities’ function. Two items (‘Seeing what kinds of 
networks and special interest groups your friends have’ and 
‘Learning about new music’) loaded on the factor, but did 
not meet the factor purity criteria.

# Para 386 9
The third factor is related to the posting and viewing of 
photographs (see Table 4), although many of the items also 
had loadings in the .3 region on the first factor. This 
suggests that these activities within Facebook may fulfill a 
number of gratifications. Specifically, the social uses of 
photographs (e.g. sharing, tagging) may also play an 
important role in ‘social connection’. However, by forming 
a unique factor, they may also be a content gratification in 
their own right.

Factor four contains items related to content within 
Facebook – for instance, applications and quizzes (see 
Table 5). This relates to the usual ‘content gratification’ 
identified in previous media research. It is worthwhile 
noting that while these items form a unique factor, the mean 
scores are relatively low. A single item (‘Looking at posted 
items’) loaded on the factor, but did not meet factor purity 
criteria.

others, however. As such, the factor is termed ‘social 
investigation’.
# Para 431 11
Factor six comprises items related to a unique affordance of 
social networking sites – the ability to view other people’s 
social networks and friends (see Table 7). This ability to 
find out more about one’s acquaintances through their 
social networks forms another important surveillance 
function, and may also be a method for increasing the size 
of one’s own social network. This specific use is termed 
‘Social network surfing’ here to signify the ability of users 
to move from one person to another via friend links, 
although it may also relate closely to a ‘process 
gratification’.

The final factor comprises items related to the newsfeed 
and status updates within Facebook. The newsfeed provides 
updates on both ‘friends’ status, alongside recent activity 
(e.g. the addition or removal of applications, changes in 
relationship status, addition of ‘friends’). Given the outcry 
when the newsfeed was introduced [2], the relative high 
scores for this use suggest an increasing degree of 
acceptance. Interestingly, a gratification (‘to keep up with 
the latest gossip’) also loaded on this factor (although only 
at the .4 level), suggesting a clear motivation for viewing 
the newsfeed.

The pattern of loadings and internal reliability (Cronbach

assumption that they are interpretable. Scales were 
developed for each factor by creating the mean score across 
the marker items.

A MANOVA test found a significant difference between 
males and females on their scores across the seven uses and 
gratifications scales (F (7, 233) = 2.662, p &lt; 0.02). Further 
analysis of the between-subjects effects on the dependent 
variables showed that scores were significantly different on 
the first factor – ‘social connection’ (F (1, 239) = 16.16, 
p&lt;0.001, η2= .063), with females scoring higher on the 
scale (M = 5.40, SD = 1.22) compared to males (M = 4.70, 
SD = 1.37), on the third factor - ‘photographs’ (F (1, 239) = 
8.95, p&lt;0.01, 112= .036), with females again scoring higher 
on the scale (M = 4.67, SD = 1.61) compared to males (M = 
4.02, SD = 1.51). There was a marginally significant 
difference across the seventh factor – ‘status updates’ (F (1, 
239) = 3.26, p=.072, r)2= .0 13), with females scoring higher 
on the scale (M = 3.94, SD = 1.40) compared to males (M = 
3.58, SD = 1.47).
# Para 502 5
A one-way between subjects ANOVA found a significant 
effect of gender on profile privacy settings (F (1, 236) = 
12.29, p &lt; .01), with females more likely to report making 
their profile more private (Mean = 4.83, SD = 1.60) 
compared to males (Mean = 4.01, SD = 1.86)
# Para 507 7
A further MANOVA test was conducted to compare 
responses to the items in light of occupational status (i.e. 
full-time student, full-time employed, part-time 
student/employed). Given the relatively low number of 
people working part-time / studying part-time, this group 
was excluded from the analysis. The results showed a 
significant overall effect of occupational status on uses and
# Para 514 5
gratifications of Facebook (F (7, 217) = 4.93, p &lt; .001), 
with significant effects for Factor 1 (social connection – F 
(1, 223) = 7.3 1, p&lt;.01), Factor 2 (shared identities – F (1, 
223) = 4.90, p&lt;.05), and Factor 3 (photographs – F (1, 223) 
= 7.85, p&lt; .01).
# Para 519 9
Full-time students scored higher on social connection and 
photographs, and lower on shared identities, compared to 
those in full-time work (Factor 1 Mean = 5.38 (SD = 1.16) 
for students, Mean = 4.89 (SD = 1.45) for full-time 
employment; Factor 2 Mean = 3.47 (SD = 1.37) for 
students, Mean = 3.90 (SD = 1.40) for full-time 
employment; Factor 3 Mean = 4.71 (SD = 1.53) for 
students, Mean = 4.09 (SD = 1.57) for full-time 
employment).
# Para 528 5
Age also correlated negatively with their scores on social 
connection (rs(225) = -.27, p&lt;.001), and photographs (rs(225) = 
-.32, p&lt;.001), with younger respondents scoring higher on 
both scales. Age did not correlate with the other factor- 
derived scales.
# Para 533 8
Age also correlated with the length of time users had been 
registered on Facebook (rs(241) = -.17, p&lt;0.01), the regularity 
with which they visited the site (rs(241) = -.18, p&lt;.01), the 
number of hours they used the site in a week (rs(241) = -.22, 
p&lt;.01) and the number of friends they had linked to their 
profile (rs(219) = -.37, p&lt;.001). In all cases, a younger user 
was associated with higher usage levels, and a greater 
number of ‘friends’.
# Para 541 5
Age was also negatively correlated with the use of privacy 
settings (rs(238) = -.17, p&lt;.01), such that younger users report 
that they were more likely to have increased the privacy of 
their profile. In part this may be due to the higher number 
of friends amongst younger users.
# Para 546 1
Predicting Facebook use
# Para 547 7
A number of earlier researchers have predicted that certain 
uses and gratifications of Facebook may be associated with 
greater use of the site. For instance, [17] note that 
completion of certain profile elements is associated with a 
greater number of ‘friends’, while the findings of [16]) 
suggest that the use of Facebook for social searching and 
surveillance motivates use.
# Para 554 10
To examine possible motivators for use of Facebook, a 
series of multiple regression equations were calculated 
using scores on the seven factor-based scales to predict both 
the frequency of visits to the site and the time spent on 
Facebook during an average week. Age, occupation and 
gender were also entered as covariates (part-time excluded). 
The results of the regression analyses to predict the 
frequency of site use are shown in Table 10. The overall 
model was significant (F (10, 213) = 4.77, p&lt;0.001, R2 = 
.15).
# Para 564 2
A second regression equation examined the same variables 
predicting the amount of time spent on the site (see Table

11). Again, the overall model was significant (F (10, 210) = 
3.85, p&lt;0.001, R2 = .12).

# Para 581 1
Table 10: Predicting frequency of visits to Facebook
# Para 582 8
The regression equations show a differential pattern of uses 
and gratifications motivating frequency of visits to the site, 
and the time spent on the site. Gender (females visit more 
frequently) and scores on the ‘photographs’ and ‘status 
updates’ factors predict the frequency of visits to the site. 
Higher scores on both scales predicted more frequent visits. 
There was a marginally significant effect of ‘social 
investigation’ (higher scores related to less frequent visits).
# Para 590 6
However, participants age (younger spend more time) and 
scores on the content gratification scale predict the actual 
number of hours spent online. This suggests that 
surveillance gratifications motivate repeat visits, but that 
content gratifications motivate people to spend longer on 
the site when they do visit.

# Para 608 7
A final regression equation was calculated to predict the 
number of ‘friends’ users reported on Facebook (see Table 
12). Given that the number of friends should be related to 
the length of time users had been registered on Facebook, 
and the intensity of their use, the usage measures (length of 
time, frequency of visit, time spent on site) were entered 
alongside the remaining variables.
# Para 615 2
The overall model was significant (F (15, 196) = 8.48, p &lt; 
.001, R2 = .31).
# Para 617 14
As might be expected, age was associated with the number 
of ‘friends’ (younger have more ‘friends’), as was the 
amount of time users had been registered on the site and the 
frequency of their site visits (longer time registered, and 
more frequent visits, associated with more friends). 
Interestingly, scores on the ‘social connection’ scale were 
not associated with ‘friend’ numbers, while scores on the 
‘content gratification’ scale were negatively associated with 
the number of ‘friends’ (i.e. higher scores associated with 
smaller number of ‘friends’). Scores on the ‘social 
investigation’ scale were positively associated with the 
number of friends, while scores on the ‘photographs’ scale 
were marginally significantly associated with an increased 
number of friends.

Use of Facebook Privacy Settings and meeting new 
people
# Para 648 5
A final set of analyses were conducted to examine the 
relationship between specific uses and respondents’ 
reported privacy profile settings. The privacy settings of 
users were grouped, according to their responses, into those 
who reported making their profile less private (n=44), those
# Para 653 1
1033
# Para 654 1

# Para 655 22
who reported leaving it at the default setting (n = 56), and 
those who reported making it more private (n = 137). In the 
main, privacy settings in Facebook allow users to hide their 
profile from people who are neither listed as ‘friends’ or 
members of the user’s own network. However, if the 
motive for using Facebook is to meet new people, then such 
privacy settings would be somewhat counter productive. To 
test this proposition, a MANOVA was conducted with 
privacy settings as the independent variable, and the 
responses to items related to meeting new people set as the 
dependent variables. The results showed a significant link 
between privacy settings and the responses to the items (F 
(8, 454) = 2.11, p &lt; .05). Analysis of the between subjects 
effects found no difference in responses to the ‘joining 
groups’ or ‘joining events’ items and privacy settings (ps &gt; 
.3), but a significant effect of reported privacy settings on 
responses to the item ‘meeting new people’ (F (2, 229) = 
4.16, p &lt; .02), and a marginally significant effect on the 
item ‘using advanced search to look for specific types of 
people’ (F (2, 229) = 2.48, p = .08). The means for the 
‘meeting new people’ item across the three privacy groups 
are shown in Figure 1.
# Para 677 2
Figure 1: Scores on ‘meeting new people’ by privacy
settings
# Para 679 6
These results suggest that for users wishing to use 
Facebook to meet new people, the privacy settings may be 
set at too stringent a level. Further analyses confirmed no 
links between the social connection scales and privacy 
settings, suggesting that a primary motivation for making 
one’s profile less private is the desire to meet new people.
# Para 685 1
DISCUSSION
# Para 686 7
Social networking sites pose a number of challenges for 
HCI researchers and practitioners. First, the actual uses and 
gratifications of such sites are not well understood. The 
present paper presents the first study of a social networking 
site using a ‘uses and gratifications’ framework, and also 
provides an empirically developed measurement tool for 
future research.
# Para 693 2
Second, previous research that has been conducted has 
tended to focus on campus-based use of Facebook [e.g. 7,
# Para 695 11
13, 6, 11, 17], which may limit the generalizability of any 
findings. However, the results of the present research 
support many of the conclusions of earlier research 
conducted on student populations. For instance, the 
distinction previously drawn between ‘social searching’ and 
‘social browsing’ uses of Facebook [16] was similarly 
evident in the present research. Moreover, in keeping with 
prior student-users research [e.g. 7, 16], the use of 
Facebook to ‘keep in touch’ was the most commonly 
mentioned term in Study 1, and formed a large proportion 
of the items comprising the first factor in Study 2.
# Para 706 13
However, the adoption of a uses and gratifications approach 
enables us to begin to probe in more depth the exact nature 
of ‘keeping in touch’ as both a use and a gratification. The 
results of the present study suggest that ‘keeping in touch’ 
comprises two main functions. The first is a surveillance 
function as identified by Lampe and colleagues [16]. 
Facebook is used to see what old contacts and friends are 
‘up to’, how they look and how they behave. In keeping 
with this use, there is evidence that Facebook profiles serve 
an important self-presentation tool [26]. Associated with 
this use is the social capital building gratification, where 
Facebook is used to build, invest in and maintain ties with 
distant friends and contacts [7, 11].
# Para 719 14
The ‘social search’ and ‘social browsing’ uses of Facebook 
identified by Lampe and colleagues [16] were closely 
related in the present study. The use of Facebook to search 
for new people loaded on the same factor as the use of 
Facebook to research offline contacts. This ‘virtual people 
watching’ was represented in both Factors 5 and 6, with the 
important distinction that Factor 6 relied primarily on 
‘friend of friend’ connections, while Factor 5 represented 
targeted investigation of people met offline, or searched for. 
Symptomatic of this distinction is the difference between 
‘looking up’ (Factor 5) and ‘looking at’ (Factor 6) people. 
In the present study, only social investigation was 
associated with a higher number of ‘friends’, not social 
network browsing.
# Para 733 15
Interestingly, an increased score on the content gratification 
scale was negatively related to the number of ‘friends’ 
reported to be linked to one’s profile. This perhaps suggests 
a sub-set of users gain gratification through the use of 
applications within Facebook, rather than through the 
accrual of ‘friends’. However, many of the applications 
available in Facebook are social in nature (e.g. scrabble 
games, ways to rate friends). But, at present these 
applications tend to rely on existing contacts, rather than the 
accrual of new ‘friends’. As such, they may serve to 
strengthen social ties, rather than acting to increase the 
overall size of a social network. Thus, investment of time 
and effort in social applications within Facebook may be 
akin to messaging between friends [11] – it solidifies ties, 
rather than creating new links.
# Para 748 2
Users responses on the scales created from the factors also 
predicted their pattern of use of the site. In keeping with

# Para 762 25
earlier work on traditional media, content gratification 
predicted the amount of time spent on the site. However, 
the use of the site for social investigation, viewing and 
posting photographs and viewing status updates predicted 
the frequency of visits. It would seem from the present data 
that ‘keeping in touch’ may in actuality refer to ‘checking 
up on regularly’, while the ‘stickiness’ of the site (in terms 
of time spent on it) depends on use of the content and 
applications. This insight is clearly important for designers 
of social networking sites and associated content. If repeat 
visits are motivated by different uses and gratifications than 
the amount of time spent on the site, it is important to 
design content gratification alongside the ability to build 
and maintain social connections. It also suggests that the 
furor caused by the introduction of the newsfeed [2] has 
subsided, and been replaced by its new role as a ‘killer 
app’, at least in terms of repeat visits to the site. In many 
ways, this use of Facebook reflects the desire for ‘perpetual 
contact’ [15], and previously supplied by standalone 
services like Twitter [24]. While the social implications of 
this interest in perpetual contact and updates on ‘friends’ 
are beyond the remit of the present paper, it is worth noting 
that an increased awareness of others’ actions has 
potentially important implications for how we relate to 
others, and understand ourselves.
# Para 787 1
Design Implications
# Para 788 13
The designers of social networking sites should consider the 
varied uses and gratifications reported by users, and need to 
recognize that not all users have the same uses of a social 
networking site, nor derive the same gratifications from 
their use. For instance, there are clear distinctions between 
the use of Facebook to maintain and re-create connections 
with friends, its use as a surveillance tool and for content 
delivery. There were also differences in reported uses by 
age, gender and occupational status. It may be that different 
demographic groups are motivated to use social networking 
sites for different purposes, with social connectivity and 
perpetual contact motivating younger (and female) users 
more than older (and male) users.
# Para 801 16
The differing goals for the use of Facebook are reflected not 
only in usage patterns, but also in users’ privacy settings. 
People who have made their privacy settings more 
permissive are more likely to want to meet new people 
(they also score higher on the content gratifications scale). 
This is a designed aspect of the system – in both cases, to 
fulfill one’s goal often requires a more permissive approach 
to profile privacy. Many of the applications are social in 
nature (e.g. comparing oneself with others, asking questions 
to ‘friends’, viewing people from one’s neighborhood), and 
often circumvent elements of the default privacy settings. 
Similarly, if the goal is to meet new people, making one’s 
profile more open than by default allows others pursuing 
the same gratification to view your profile, and presumably 
increases the chances of an interaction. For these users, the 
profile within Facebook is likely to become a key self-
# Para 817 2
presentation tool, rather than simply a way to ‘keep in 
touch’ with others [6, 26].
# Para 819 1
Limitations and Further research
# Para 820 19
The present research is a ‘snap shot’ of Facebook users, and 
further work should consider the possibility of researching 
the development of use over time. In particular, it would be 
of interest to see how people’s uses and gratifications of 
Facebook develop, and if the frequency of visit is motivated 
by ‘perpetual contact’ over time. There is, for instance, 
considerable research in the field of habit formation that 
could inform the study of social network site use. HCI 
research should also consider ways in which the desire to 
meet new people, and to allow oneself to be viewed by 
strangers, can be accommodated in a privacy-protecting 
manner [14]. At present, Facebook has reasonably nuanced 
privacy controls. From the results of the present research, it 
would seem that users are changing the default privacy 
settings in a motivated manner. However, the present study 
only collected reported privacy settings. It would be 
prudent to complete research that actually examined 
settings via automated querying of the site [e.g. 13], or by 
studying a corpus of actual interactions [e.g. 11].
# Para 839 6
It should also be noted that the nature of the sampling 
method, and the self-selection of respondents, may have 
influenced the pattern of responses and overall levels of 
activity. Future research may wish to study a wider group 
of participants, or attempt to identify patterns of usage 
amongst non-respondents compared to respondents
# Para 845 1
CONCLUSIONS
# Para 846 13
Users derive a variety of uses and gratifications from social 
networking sites, including traditional content gratification 
alongside building social capital, communication, 
surveillance and social networking surfing. The different 
uses and gratifications relate differentially to patterns of 
usage, with social connection gratifications tending to lead 
to increased frequency of use, and content gratifications to 
increased time spent on the site. The variety of uses to 
which Facebook is put by its users identifies particular 
challenges for the designers of such sites. For instance, a 
default privacy setting may be too restrictive for users 
seeking to meet new people, or who wish to allow new 
people to discover them.
# Para 859 12
Since user’s desire to engage in surveillance of their peers 
also motivates the frequency of site visit, this also poses a 
unique challenge in balancing user’s privacy concerns and 
controls with a key raison d’être of social networking sites 
like Facebook. At present, Facebook allows users to 
manage their ‘feed’, removing ‘stories’ as they wish. This 
solution not only provides a degree of privacy control to 
users, but it also enables users to engage with the site as a 
self-presentation tool [26] at numerous levels – not only via 
their profile and network, but also through their activity 
(and the removal of specific ‘stories’). As perpetual contact 
continues to develop, designers will need to face the
